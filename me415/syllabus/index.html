<!-- ## Objective

Develop your ability to use fundamental engineering principles to analyze and design air/space vehicles, and develop communication skills to prepare you to be amongst the world's most influential engineers. -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Overview</h2>

<p>This course examines fundamental principles for designing flight vehicles (e.g., airplanes and rockets).  This includes introductions to aerodynamics, structures, stability, propulsion, and performance.  Rather than diving deeply into any one discipline, our focus is on understanding fundamental trade-offs amongst these multidisciplinary considerations to allow one to approach vehicle-level design problems.  This class will involve a combination of theory, computational methods, and a hands-on project.</p>

<p>The content of this class is the typical launching point for a mechanical engineering wishing to specialize in aerospace engineering.  Subsequent classes provide greater depth on these topics that we can only cover at an introductory level in this class: aerodynamics (515), gas turbine and jet engine design (426), compressible fluid flow (510), computational fluid dynamics (541), design optimization (575), composites (456, 602), aircraft structures (523), control systems (431), flight dynamics and control (634).</p>

<p>What you take away from the course will greatly depend on your attitude, diligence, initiative, and willingness to work with and learn from others.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Prerequisites: ME EN 273, ME EN 312 (the latter may be taken concurrently)</p>

<p>This course assumes no prior exposure to aircraft/spacecraft, but you will need a foundation in engineering fundamentals (numerical methods/programming, fluids, dynamics, structures).</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p><strong>Aerodynamics</strong>: Analyze and measure aerodynamic forces and moments.</p>

<p><strong>Structures</strong>: Analyze structural response to aerodynamic and inertial loads.</p>

<p><strong>Stability</strong>: Analyze longitudinal and lateral stability both statically and dynamically.</p>

<p><strong>Propulsion</strong>: Analyze thrust and propulsive efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Select appropriate performance metrics, and evaluate performance.</p>

<p><strong>Trajectories</strong>: Analyze trajectories and orbits for space vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>Integrated Design</strong>: Analyze and design a flight vehicle for a specified mission using a well-reasoned and clearly articulated approach.</p>

<!-- ## Course Content

This course is organized around four main topics: external flow, compressible flow, turbomachines, and computational fluid dynamics.   Throughout these topics we will reinforce our understanding of different forms of the governing equations of fluid flow and explore a wide variety of applications.  An overview of some of the topics we will discuss are listed below.

- External Flow
    - lift and drag
    - boundary layers
- Compressible Flow
    - 1D Area-Mach relationships
    - normal shocks, oblique shocks, compression waves
- Turbomachines
    - blade element momentum theory
    - design and application
- Computational Fluid Dynamics
    - discretization of equations
    - meshing, boundary conditions, solving, post-processing, V&V

<!-- or [SU2](http://su2.stanford.edu). -->
<!-- - airfoil and wing analysis theories -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-4">Course Work</h2>

<p>Please keep in mind the level of time commitment expected (from the <a href="http://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2011-2012ucat/GeneralInfo/Registration.php">registrar’s office</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The expectation for undergraduate courses is three hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared; much more time may be required to achieve excellence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the <em>average</em> student will need to put in at least 6.5 hours of work outside of the classroom each week.</p>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>Good: attend class regularly and punctually.<br />
Better: attend and be attentive in class.<br />
Best: attend, be attentive, and <strong>actively participate</strong> in the classroom discussion.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask what you think might be a simple question, usually someone else is wondering the same thing and you are doing them a favor by asking.  Be respectful of your peers and arrive to class on time (but if you are late please don’t feel like you can’t come in).  You may use electronic devices in the classroom only if they are being used appropriately for class activities (e.g., taking notes).</p>

<p>Class time should not be a passive experience.  In addition to asking questions, you should come prepared to work on problems in class. I will often ask you to work individually or with small groups on example problems and design exercises in class.  Many of these problems you won’t know how to solve.  That may be uncomfortable at first, but this struggle will help you to learn concepts more deeply and become better engineering problem solvers.</p>

<p>I provide slides for each lecture.  They are intentionally sparse.  Studies suggest that you will learn and retain information better by taking notes, so I intentionally avoid providing you with detailed notes.  On the other hand, requiring you to copy down lots of information won’t give you space to think in class.  The goal of the slides is to hopefully reach a happy medium.  The lecture slides are used to provide organization and display items that would be time consuming to write down (e.g., images, long equations).  Important details are elaborated on in class, and it is expected that you will be taking good notes.  Some students like to use the slides as a background to write their notes on.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Most class periods will have an assigned reading, and I expect you to complete the readings beforehand.  I cannot, not would it be effective to, cover all the content you need to know in class.  Instead, class time will be used for discussing difficult concepts, diving deeper into or expanding on concepts you were exposed to in your reading, answering questions, working examples together, and testing understanding.  Readings will come from <em>Introduction to Flight</em> by John Anderson (5th, 6th, 7th, or 8th Ed.), as well as notes that I will provide.  I will also directly you to (optional) supplementary readings for those interested in more depth in particularly topics.</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>Homework will typically be due every Wednesday at midnight (actually 11:59pm) and will be turned in via Learning Suite.  Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 15% per day.  Last minute issues often happen in life so be sure to start your work early and submit early!  Homework will largely be design oriented, but will also involve a mix of traditional textbook problems, computational implementation and analysis, and experimental data gathering and processing.</p>

<!-- , and the use of computational fluid dynamics software. -->

<!-- Homework will be primarily self-graded.  I will provided detailed solutions/guides, and you will assess your own work.  Reviewing your own work with a guided solution will help you better understand concepts you may have missed.  For some problems, you will also be given the opportunity to rework the problem.  Mistakes can be some of our most effective teachers, but to take advantage of the learning opportunity we must try again. -->

<!-- We will grade the homework in a timely manner and provide you with feedback to assist in your learning. -->

<p>Assignments are expected to be produced in report format.  A series of equations and “solutions” is insufficient.  Each report should introduce the problem and any assumptions, detail the methodology, and discuss the results and conclusions.  Use full sentences, not bullet points.  Imagine your audience to be a colleague or supervisor—someone who understands your field but is not necessarily familiar with the details of your particular problem.  Why a report format?  You will learn deeper by having to explain in words, improve your writing skills, practice for future reports in your engineering career, and be able to access and understand your work when referring to it later.</p>

<p>Working with others on homework is certainly encouraged, but you must prepare your own reports.  <strong>Referring to solution manuals or prior student’s homework  is a violation of the honor code.</strong></p>

<!-- One or two of the assignments will involve a collaboration with students in Dr. Salmon's section of ME EN 273 (Intro to Sci Computing).  This will give you an opportunity to explain concepts and mentor others, which is one of the most effective ways to learn, and the opportunity to delegate portions of the problem, allowing you to tackle a richer, more interesting problem. The scientific computing students will benefit from exposure to applications in fluid mechanics they have not learned yet, adding context and motivation to what they are studying, and the opportunity to receive direct mentoring from others who recently learned the material themselves. -->

<!-- , which adds a valuable perspective different from that of the course instructor. -->

<h3 id="project">Project</h3>

<p>The homework is built around two main projects.  The first project will be done individually and will involve the (virtual) design of an air/space vehicle chosen from a selection of modern missions (e.g., a high altitude long endurance aircraft or a reusable rocket).  The second project will be done in teams and will involve designing, building, and flying a model air/space vehicle for a basic mission.  More details on the project will be contained in the homework assignments.</p>

<!-- You will work in pairs to explore a fluid dynamic application of interest.  You will produce an end product with the goal of helping others learn about your application.  The medium of this product is up to you.  Examples include: a report, a video, a poster, a tutorial, etc.  Final products will be made available publicly unless extenuating circumstances exist.  You will also have an opportunity to give a brief in-class presentation.  More details on this project are available [here](../schedule/project).  You may also see past projects under [Resources](../resources). -->

<h3 id="quizzes-and-exams">Quizzes and Exams</h3>

<p>There will be frequent quizzes to engage your thinking on important concepts, assess your understanding, and practice for the exams.  There will be two midterm exams and one comprehensive final exam.</p>

<!-- Quizzes will be partially graded for correctness and partially for participation.   -->

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>An approximate percent breakdown is as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Homework and Labs</td>
      <td>50%</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>

<p>The TAs and I hold office hours, and want to make ourselves as available as possible.  In addition to normal office hours, we use Piazza to assist you in asking for and giving help.  Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates, the TA, and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza.  After signing up for an account, you may want to visit your notification preferences (I prefer batch notifications).  <strong>We also use Piazza for all class announcements, so make sure to sign up!</strong></p>

<p>Finally, we will have a weekly TA-led recitation section.  In this session we will review concepts, work through examples, demonstrate Star-CCM+ tasks, and answer questions.  Attendance is optional.  We try to anticipate common problems/questions to discuss in the session, and answer the questions that you bring.  The primary focus of these sessions will be Star-CCM+ examples to help you with the homework assignments.</p>

<!-- Because many people will have the same questions, it will be more effective to address them as a group.   -->

<!-- Our class page can be found at: https://piazza.com/byu/fall2015/meen412/home -->

<!-- Office hours will be much less effective if you go in expecting to see homework problems worked out for you. This will rob you of much of the learning the problem was designed for.  Even asking for examples of similar problems is usually not the best place to begin if your objective is real learning.  The most effective engineers, and the most exciting and rewarding careers, will involve solving problems that are unlike those anyone has solved before.  The goal of office hours (and homework) is to help you to that end.  In other words, we are less interested in getting to "solutions", and more interesting in developing problem skills and engineering understanding. -->

<!-- Instead of asking how to solve the problem or to see a related example, describe where you are stuck and what you think you need help with, ask questions on concepts you don't understand, brainstorm ideas on how to move forward and ask for feedback, try things and don't be afraid to fail.  On some problems you may feel like you don't know where to begin and don't even know what questions to ask.  Simplify the problem and make at least one attempt even if it seems horribly wrong.  Be prepared for the TA or I to ask you lots of questions to probe understanding and help guide you in the discovery process.  After wrestling with the problem and discussing concepts for a while, working out related examples or parts of the homework problem together is entirely appropriate, but this shouldn't be the starting place. -->

<h3 id="advice">Advice</h3>

<p>Beginning engineering students sometimes get stuck in the mindset of trying to find the “right way” or “right answer” to a problem.  Real problems are complex and open ended.  Good engineers take the time to deeply understand the problem before trying to find solutions, are able to think of various potential approaches and justify their selected methodology, and can clearly present their findings.</p>

<p>Engineers need to be able to work well with others.   Learn from and help your peers.  Form study groups.  Get to know the TAs and the instructor in office hours.  Don’t be afraid to ask for help.</p>

<p>The importance of technical writing skills are often under-appreciated by engineering students.  Take advantage of opportunities to practice your writing and oral communication skills and learn how to express ideas clearly.</p>

<p>Scientific programming skills are highly valued and will help you explore engineering concepts.  Many students understand syntax, but fewer can effectively translate ideas and concepts to code, debug effectively, and organize code clearly and logically.</p>

<p>Worry less about grades and more about learning.  Have fun!  Find things that interest you and take the initiative to dive deeper!</p>

<!-- Focus less on reaching a preconceived final answer and focus more on understanding the process.   -->

<!-- Any application involving fluid mechanics is acceptable, but choose something you are excited about.  You will prepare a "handout" that other students could read to learn about your application.  You can include any elements (e.g., text, figures, videos, examples, quizes, etc.) that you think would be helpful to assist someone else in their learning.  The handout can be delivered in any format that you think is most effective to aid someone else's learning: text document, presentation, web page, etc.  You will have the opportunity to read two handouts from other groups and will provide feedback.  During the last two days of class each team will have a  -->

<!-- - Learn StarCCM+, Labs.
- Open Syllabus.  Students decide rules.  Late policy on assignments.  Exam format.  
- Project: students prepare notes on any fluid application.  Teams of 2.  Prepare handout (LaTeX, Word, IPython notebook).  Last two days of class you will have 1-2 slides and 4 minutes to present.
 -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-5">University Policies</h2>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university’s expectation, and every instructor’s expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-sexual-misconduct">Preventing Sexual Misconduct</h3>

<p>As required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the university prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual harassment-including sexual violence-committed by or against students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of “Sexual Misconduct” prohibited by the university.</p>

<p>University policy requires any university employee in a teaching, managerial, or supervisory role to report incidents of sexual misconduct that come to their attention through various forms including face-to-face conversation, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. If you encounter Sexual Misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or 801-422-2130 or Ethics Point at https://titleix.byu.edu/report or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours). Additional information about Title IX and resources available to you can be found at http://titleix.byu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="student-disability">Student Disability</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 422-2767. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895, D-285 ASB.</p>

<h3 id="inappropriate-use-of-course-materials">Inappropriate Use Of Course Materials</h3>

<p>All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code.</p>

<h3 id="respectful-environment">Respectful Environment</h3>

<p>“Sadly, from time to time, we do hear reports of those who are at best insensitive and at worst insulting in their comments to and about others… We hear derogatory and sometimes even defamatory comments about those with different political, athletic, or ethnic views or experiences. Such behavior is completely out of place at BYU, and I enlist the aid of all to monitor carefully and, if necessary, correct any such that might occur here, however inadvertent or unintentional. “I worry particularly about demeaning comments made about the career or major choices of women or men either directly or about members of the BYU community generally. We must remember that personal agency is a fundamental principle and that none of us has the right or option to criticize the lawful choices of another.” President Cecil O. Samuelson, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010 “Occasionally, we … hear reports that our female faculty feel disrespected, especially by students, for choosing to work at BYU, even though each one has been approved by the BYU Board of Trustees. Brothers and sisters, these things ought not to be. Not here. Not at a university that shares a constitution with the School of the Prophets.” Vice President John S. Tanner, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010</p>

<h3 id="devotional-attendance">Devotional Attendance</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University’s devotional and forum assemblies are an important part of your BYU experience. President Cecil O. Samuelson said, “We have special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies…that will complement, supplement, and enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday…and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you…A large part of what constitutes the unique ‘BYU experience’ is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus” (from the address “The Legacy of Learning”, 30 August, 2005). Your attendance at each forum and devotional is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h3>

<p>Mental health concerns and stressful life events can affect students’ academic performance and quality of life. BYU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS, 1500 WSC, 801-422-3035, caps.byu.edu) provides individual, couples, and group counseling, as well as stress management services. These services are confidential and are provided by the university at no cost for full-time students. For general information please visit https://caps.byu.edu; for more immediate concerns please visit http://help.byu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to “be honest.” Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life’s work, but also to build character. “President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education” (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another’s words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgement, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author’s own. Plagiarism Mosaic-The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one’s own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student’s work and submitting it as one’s own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.</p>
