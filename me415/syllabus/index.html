<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">What is this course about?</h2>

<p>At the heart of the course is a hands-on, team project where you will design, build, and fly a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to complete a specified mission.  To be successful in this objective you will need to understand the fundamentals of aircraft design including: aerodynamics, structures, stability, propulsion, and performance.  These topics will be taught and explored more broadly than that required for just small UAVs in order to give you a solid introduction to aerospace engineering.  While we don’t have time in one semester to also build a rocket, you will also learn some fundamentals for rocket analysis and design.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">How does this course relate to other courses?</h2>

<p>The content of this class is the typical launching point for a mechanical engineering wishing to specialize in aerospace engineering.  Subsequent courses provide greater depth on topics that we can only cover at an introductory level in this class: aerodynamics (515), gas turbine and jet engine design (426), compressible fluid flow (510), computational fluid dynamics (541), design optimization (575), composites (456, 602), aircraft structures (523), control systems (431), flight dynamics and control (634).</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">What are the prerequisites?</h2>

<p>Formally, the listed prerequisites are: ME EN 273, ME EN 312.  The latter may be taken concurrently, but you will need to read ahead to familiarize yourself with <a href="../schedule/review">some concepts</a> from that course.</p>

<p>Some of you are from other departments, like physics.  You’ll be just fine, though you should ask your classmates for help, as needed, in explaining some engineering concepts from fluids, dynamics, and structures that are re-used in this class.</p>

<p>We do <em>not</em> assume any prior exposure to aircraft or spacecraft.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-4">What textbook will we use?</h2>

<p>You do not need to purchase a textbook.  Instead I will provide a text that I am developing specifically for this class.  It is being developed as we go so please be patient with the timing and its rough edges.  Chapters can be downloaded from <a href="https://byu.box.com/v/me415book">here</a>.  I am doing this for three reasons: 1) I want to save you money as you’ll need to buy parts for your UAV (more on this below) 2) I don’t know of any <em>one</em> textbook at the appropriate level or with the right mix of topics for this class, and 3) tailoring the content to exactly what we need frees up how we spend our in-class time (more on this below).</p>

<p>I do recommend <em>Introduction to Flight</em> by John Anderson (any edition) as a supplementary text.  It is not necessary for the class, but will provide more context for those interested in exploring this topic further.  The level of the text is a bit too basic for our needs, but it is a good introduction to a broad range of topics.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-5">What will the in-class experience be like?</h2>

<p>There will be a mix of lecture, questions, and in-class assignments.  Listening to me talk for 50 minutes is usually not the most effective use of our time together.  Therefore, you will be expected to do some reading and preparation before each class to reduce in-class lecture time.  The lecture portion of class will be shorter and focus on answering questions, discussing more difficult concepts, and presenting visuals that don’t work well in a textbook.  Moving some of the informational content to out of class will allow us to do more in-class examples and exercises that will help you learn deeper and work more effectively on your out-of-class assignments</p>

<p>You should be attentive and ask questions.  Don’t be afraid to ask what you think might be a simple question, usually others are wondering the same thing and you are doing them a favor by asking.  Don’t expect to come and just sit passively the whole time.  Be prepared to work on problems in class. There are some computers in the classroom that will be helpful with some in-class assignments, but if you have access to a laptop it will often be helpful to bring it.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-6">What about the Thursday labs?</h2>

<p>Most of the labs will occur during the first half of the semester.  Labs will typically involve instruction and hands-on practice of model aircraft construction skill.  Labs focus on supplementary help as opposed to primary instruction, so if you have a conflict during that time you should be fine, but I’d recommend asking a classmate to go through it with you later.  If a lab is covering a topic you are already comfortable with, feel free to skip it, or come and help others who are less experienced.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-7">What are the material costs?</h2>

<p>You will need to purchase most of the materials for your UAV (and will keep them).  We will provide access to tools and a transmitter for use during the semester.  You should not spend more than $50 per individual (or $250 per team).</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-8">How time-intensive will this class be?</h2>

<p>The time commitment for any undergraduate class should be pretty standard.  The level of time commitment expected by the <a href="http://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2011-2012ucat/GeneralInfo/Registration.php">university</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The expectation for undergraduate courses is three hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared; much more time may be required to achieve excellence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last year students spent 10 hours per week on average (compared to the minimum university requirement of 9, and the department average of 10.5).  I don’t know what the variance was, but I expect that the open-ended nature of the project, and the complexity of team dynamics, means that your mileage may vary.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-9">How difficult will this class be?</h2>

<p>One of the aspects students find hard about this class is that much of it is open ended.  You may be used to, and comfortable with, prescribed approaches to solving homework problems (step 1, step 2, etc.).  Aircraft design is complex, and most of the time I cannot provide you with a one-size-fits-all approach.  Or, if I did, it would often be wrong and misleading.  It’s a lot like the quote from Joseph Smith: “I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.”  You’ll learn principles in this class, and will need to wrestle some with how to apply them.  Understandably, your inexperience will make it hard to always know how to use them, but we (instructor, TAs, fellow classmates) are here to help.</p>

<p>You should expect some messiness and set backs (no surprise to those of you who have taken a project class like mechatronics).  You will most likely experience one or all of the following: difficulty running a piece of software, a major crash of your UAV (or crashes!) necessitating rebuilding, problems getting some code to work, inexperience in craftsmanship necessitating some rebuilding, a flawed design requiring some major rework.  Don’t worry: this is normal, expected, and even desirable as part of the learning process.  We tend to learn the most from our mistakes.</p>

<p>Sometimes this question is really code for what grade can I expect.  I can’t answer that individually, but collectively I can say that the average grade for this class was a little above department/college averages for an upper division undergraduate course.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-10">What is homework like and when is it due?</h2>

<p>There will generally be a weekly assignment due every Wednesday at midnight (actually 11:59pm) via Learning Suite.  Many of the problems will help you make progress on your project, though there will be some broader problems as well.</p>

<!-- There will be a peer review process for assignments (discussed below). -->

<p>Last year’s assignments will still be up on the website for about a week so you can get a feel for them.  This year’s assignments will be similar, but not exactly the same.</p>

<!-- ## What is the peer review process?

After your assignment is submitted, you will be assigned two random submissions from your classmates to review (and two people will review yours).  You will have one day to offer/receive feedback, and one day after that to revise your submission and resubmit.  You will not grade them, just offer feedback. You will receive credit for the reviews you complete by noting this in your resubmission.  We will not grade the first submission or any feedback.  We will only assess the second submission.  We use a similar process in our research lab and find that receiving prior peer feedback greatly improves the quality of the submission and reviewing other's work is instructive.  The hope is that both your scores and learning will improve. -->

<!-- ## What is the peer review?

For each assignment you will ask one other person to review your work and offer feedback as if they were grading it (but they won't assign a grade).  You will receive credit for providing a review to someone else and will note this on your homework.  We use a similar process in our research lab and find that receiving prior peer feedback greatly improves the quality of the submission and reviewing other's work is instructive.  The hope is that both your scores and learning will improve.  While I won't require it, I encourage you to ask different people to review your work throughout the semester so that you can get different perspectives and meet other classmates.   -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-11">What about late work?</h2>

<p>Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 20% per day.  Last minute issues often happen in life so be sure to start your work early and submit early!  Despite your best planning you will likely have an unexpected event, obligation, or illness pop up.  To help with this, I will drop your lowest homework score.  This policy is designed to help with unexpected issues so please don’t ask for homework extensions or other exceptions (unless you have an extreme or extended event like a hospitalization or death in the family).</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-12">Can I work with others?  What about student work from prior years?</h2>

<p>Working with others on homework is definitely encouraged, but you must do your own write-ups.  <strong>Referring to solution manuals or student work from previous years is a violation of department policy and the honor code.</strong></p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-13">What format should the homework be in?</h2>

<p>Assignments are expected to be produced in a report or memo format.  A series of equations and “solutions” is insufficient.  Each report should introduce the problem and any assumptions, detail the methodology, and discuss the results and conclusions (the <a href="http://me.byu.edu/sites/default/files/What%20Is%20IMRaD.pdf">IMRaD</a> format).  <a href="https://byu.box.com/s/0l6z1i0twr82gxsim3c179q3pzr4tu0x">Here</a> is an example solution from a question I asked in a different class.  Not everyone problem requires this must detail, but in general, many students do not provide sufficient detail on their first homework and/or provide figures that are not clearly presented.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-14">How will we progress on the project?</h2>

<p>Mostly it is up to you to exercise discipline and set aside regular time to make progress (even when the final deadline is far away).  The homework assignments will often directly help, and there will be two design reviews with some associated milestones to help keep you on track.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-15">What about exams?</h2>

<p>There will be two midterm exams and one comprehensive final exam.  They will be timed so that you don’t waste time endlessly revisiting, but I don’t believe in testing your speed so I try to design them with ample time (for most people—it’s hard to please everyone).  The format is subject to change, but will likely be take-home via Learning Suite.</p>

<p>There will also be periodic low-weight quizzes to help you and I gauge understanding and reinforce concepts.  Quizzes will be graded partially for correctness and partially for participation.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-16">How will I be graded?</h2>

<p>Many (but not all) problems don’t have a “correct answer”, as is generally true in real-world engineering.  Primarily we are looking for good engineering work: clarity, justifiable assumptions, technically sound procedures, critical evaluation of the results.  Be sure that you address each item asked for in the problem statement.</p>

<p>Project milestones have rubrics attached to them.</p>

<p>Because of the logistics required in grading 40+ exams, much of the exams will be built around correct answers.</p>

<p>The approximate percent breakdown is: 40% homework, 40% exams, 20% project.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-17">How can I get help?</h2>

<p>I will have office hours, as will the TAs.  Additionally, we use <a href="https://piazza.com/byu/fall2018/meen415">Piazza</a> to assist you in asking for and giving help.  Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates, the TA, and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza.  After signing up for an account, you may wish to visit your notification preferences (I prefer batch notifications).  <strong>We also use Piazza for all class announcements, so be sure to sign up!</strong></p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-18">University and Department Policies</h2>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university’s expectation, and every instructor’s expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty-department">Academic Honesty (Department)</h3>

<p>As part of an overall teaching/learning approach to aid student learning, the course instructor may make available to students solutions to some prior coursework. However, outside of this appropriate usage, relying on and/or copying solutions (obtained online or from any source) to assigned coursework represents a clear example of turning in work that is not your own.</p>

<h3 id="inappropriate-use-of-course-materials">Inappropriate Use Of Course Materials</h3>

<p>All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code.</p>

<h3 id="preventing--responding-to-sexual-misconduct">Preventing &amp; Responding to Sexual Misconduct</h3>

<p>In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Brigham Young University prohibits unlawful sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. The university also prohibits sexual harassment—including sexual violence—committed by or against students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of “Sexual Misconduct” prohibited by the university.</p>

<p>University policy requires all university employees in a teaching, managerial, or supervisory role to report all incidents of Sexual Misconduct that come to their attention in any way, including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post.  Incidents of Sexual Misconduct should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or (801) 422-8692.

<h3 id="respectful-environment">Respectful Environment</h3>

<p>“Sadly, from time to time, we do hear reports of those who are at best insensitive and at worst insulting in their comments to and about others… We hear derogatory and sometimes even defamatory comments about those with different political, athletic, or ethnic views or experiences. Such behavior is completely out of place at BYU, and I enlist the aid of all to monitor carefully and, if necessary, correct any such that might occur here, however inadvertent or unintentional. “I worry particularly about demeaning comments made about the career or major choices of women or men either directly or about members of the BYU community generally. We must remember that personal agency is a fundamental principle and that none of us has the right or option to criticize the lawful choices of another.” President Cecil O. Samuelson, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010 “Occasionally, we … hear reports that our female faculty feel disrespected, especially by students, for choosing to work at BYU, even though each one has been approved by the BYU Board of Trustees. Brothers and sisters, these things ought not to be. Not here. Not at a university that shares a constitution with the School of the Prophets.” Vice President John S. Tanner, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010</p>

<h3 id="devotional-attendance">Devotional Attendance</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University’s devotional and forum assemblies are an important part of your BYU experience. President Cecil O. Samuelson said, “We have special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies…that will complement, supplement, and enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday…and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you…A large part of what constitutes the unique ‘BYU experience’ is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus” (from the address “The Legacy of Learning”, 30 August, 2005). Your attendance at each forum and devotional is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h3>

<p>Mental health concerns and stressful life events can affect students’ academic performance and quality of life. BYU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS, 1500 WSC, 801-422-3035, caps.byu.edu) provides individual, couples, and group counseling, as well as stress management services. These services are confidential and are provided by the university at no cost for full-time students. For general information please visit https://caps.byu.edu; for more immediate concerns please visit http://help.byu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to “be honest.” Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life’s work, but also to build character. “President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education” (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another’s words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgement, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author’s own. Plagiarism Mosaic-The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one’s own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student’s work and submitting it as one’s own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.</p>
