<p>The goal of the project is to work as team to design, build, and fly an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle to complete a specified mission.</p>

<p><strong>Team</strong>: You will self-select a team of 5 (a few teams may have 4 if necessary).  Choose one person to be a team lead.  Defining other roles of specialization is often helpful, but is at your discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong>: Using the provided micro-controller you will program an aircraft to fly autonomously through three specified waypoints.  The waypoints will be given as pairs of GPS lat, long coordinates with an 10 m allowable radius.  The aircraft must stay above 100 ft and below 400 ft relative to ground at all times (except during RC controlled landing when it can of course go lower).  The only sensors you will have are a GPS and an altimeter.  Any code added to the autopilot must be written by a member of the team (i.e., you cannot use existing code).</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/fly_for_fun/">FAA guidelines</a> for model aircraft!  Remember, if the aircraft is drifting beyond sight, over people, or near other restricted areas/obstacles you must switch to RC mode and immediately fly back to safety.</li>
  <li>Always be in the room when charging batteries.  They are a fire hazard if left unattended.</li>
  <li>Never drain a battery completely (i.e., don’t leave it plugged into your speed controller overnight).  Otherwise, it will no longer hold a charge.</li>
  <li>Don’t exceed 20 m/s ground speed at any time.</li>
  <li>Don’t fly when it is windy or gusty.  Early morning is often a good time to avoid wind.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flying</strong>: New planes (or significantly modified existing planes) must be checked off with a TA before flying.  Bring this flight checklist with you and go through it before <strong>every</strong> flight.  One or more of your team members may train to be a pilot if desired.  You will need to pass off to the TAs before you will be allowed to fly.  Alternatively, we will provide pilots that can fly for you.</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong>: The maximum allowable wingspan is 1 m. The only motors and propellers you can use are the ones provided.  Everything else about the design is up to you!  Because the autopilot will be relatively basic, you will need to create a reasonably stable and efficient aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>: There main deliverable is the final report.  Details on the final report are linked on the class schedule.</p>

<!-- You can make as many attempts as you want to complete the objective,  -->

<!-- are two main deliverables: the final report and the flyoff.  The report will be graded on xxxx.  Put the name(s) of the people who contributed to each section of the report.   -->

<!-- 50: completed mission
40: nearly completed mission, but either missed a waypoint or violated an altitude limit.
30: partial completion of mission
20:
10: -->
