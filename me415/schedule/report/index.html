<span style="float:right;">175 possible points</span></p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>Your report must be submitted in PDF format.  The cover page should contain your team name, the names of all team members, and a nice photo (or rendering) of your aircraft. Refer to the <a href="https://me.byu.edu/students/resources">BYU ME Writing Materials</a> for general writing guidance.  Here is a past <a href="https://byu.box.com/s/imtw2b7mjkhhbt9mdlo9p05d3vvxtolu">example report</a> that scored well (note the mission and requirements were not exactly the same).</p>

<h2 id="report-rubric-125-points">Report Rubric (125 points)</h2>

<p>Design (40%):</p>
<ul>
  <li>[5 pts] Overall configuration choices are appropriate and soundly justified.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Airfoil selection is appropriate and soundly justified.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Wing design is appropriate and soundly justified.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Predicted and measured weights are shown with discussion on how it affected the design if applicable.  Design is not overly heavy.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Tail/canard/sweep sizing is appropriate and soundly justified.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] A proper static and dynamic stability analysis is shown with discussion on how it affected the design.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] An analysis of the propulsion system is included.  System is efficient and suited to the aircraft.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Overall performance is shown with reasonable results (range, endurance, L/D, cruise speed and CL, CLmax, climb rate).  Performance metrics are appropriate.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Fully dimensioned aircraft with 3 views are shown.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Overall quality of design analysis.</li>
  <li>[+5 pts] (extra credit) Exceptional analysis and/or design novelty.</li>
</ul>

<p>Build/Test/Fly (40%):</p>
<ul>
  <li>[5 pts] Evidence of an improved design through lessoned learned while building.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Evidence of good building technique.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Evidence of a built aircraft that (reasonably) matches the design.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Evidence of good flight testing and observations from flight testing.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Evidence of improvements made from flight testing.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Evidence of good flight performance (videos or links to videos are welcome!).</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Good description of gps logic/methods.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Evidence that gps logic works well (ground tests are fine).</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Mission attempt(s) clearly described and plotted.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Good description of L/D and climb rate calculations and measurements (if they exist).</li>
  <li>[+5 pts] (extra credit) Exceptional build techniques and/or innovation.</li>
</ul>

<!-- - \[5 pts\] Mission attempt(s) clearly described and reported.
Mission (30%):
- \[10 pts\] Completed mission. Respected boundary and ceiling limits. Trajectory plots shown and discussed.
- \[10 pts\] Completed mission with 100 g payload (5 pts if 50 g payload).
- \[5 pts\] Evidence of following good safety practices.
- \[5 pts\] Good match/discussion in climb rate.
- \[5 pts\] Good match/discussion in descent rate.
- \[5 pts\] Good match/discussion in energy usage.
- \[5 pts\] Overall mission quality.
- \[+5 pts\] (extra credit) Highest L/D.
- \[+5 pts\] (extra credit) Highest climb rate.
- \[+5 pts\] (extra credit) Lowest energy usage.
- \[+5 pts\] (extra credit) Completed mission with 200g payload -->

<p>Writing (20%):</p>
<ul>
  <li>[5 pts] Writing is clear and cohesive.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Report is well organized.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Figures/data are nicely presented.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Level of detail is appropriate.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Good conclusions and reflections on the process.
<!-- - \[+10 pts\] (extra credit) Best report. --></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance-rubric-50-points">Performance Rubric (50 points)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>[10 pts] Hit the waypoints while respecting boundary and ceiling limits.</li>
  <li>[10 pts] Carried the banner during mission.</li>
  <li>[10 pts] Good analysis/discussion for L/D (predictions and data).</li>
  <li>[10 pts] Good analysis/discussion for climb rate (predictions and data).</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Finished mission relatively quickly (i.e., didn’t have to circle around a bunch of times to hit waypoints).</li>
  <li>[5 pts] Evidence the good safety practices were followed.</li>
</ul>

<!-- - **35%**: Quality of aircraft design process.  Are the design choices reasonable and clearly justified?  Are the analyses technically sound?
- **30%**: Quality of report.  Is the writing clear and well organized?  Are figures/data presented clearly?  Does the information contain the important details while still being concise? 
- **20%**: Quality of built aircraft.  Is there evidence of good construction technique and improvements made?  Is there evidence of good flight testing and performance?
- **15%**: Mission performance.  How many waypoints were reached?  Did the aircraft stay within boundaries and altitude limits?  How long did it take to hit the waypoints? -->

<h2 id="peer-assessment">Peer Assessment</h2>

<p>Provide an assessment of the contribution level for yourself and the rest of your team members.  In the submission notes of Learning Suite, list each team member’s name including yourself, and next to each name list a number using the scale below.  You may provide additional comments if needed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>3: actively engaged.  strong contributions.</li>
  <li>2: somewhat engaged.  some contributions.</li>
  <li>1: not very engaged.  few contributions.</li>
