<p>due 12/14/2017 before midnight via Learning Suite
<span style="float:right;">100 possible points</span></p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>Your report must be submitted in PDF format.  The cover page should contain your team name, the names of all team members, and a nice photo (or rendering) of your aircraft. There is a page limit of 50 pages not including appendices.  Refer to the <a href="https://me.byu.edu/students/resources">BYU ME Writing Materials</a> for general writing guidance.</p>

<!-- Be sure to address the following in your report:
- Design Strategies
- Configuration Details and Sizing (with three-view drawings)
- Airfoil and Wing Aerodynamics
- Weights
- Stability
- Propulsion System
- Overall Performance
- Construction Details
- RC Flight Testing
- Waypoint Navigation Results (plot multiple views of full trajectories)
- Conclusions
 -->
<!-- - Control Strategy and Testing -->
<!-- You may chose to place these in different sections, but be sure to report  all of the following metrics (if you have both predicted and measured for some then report both):
- range
- endurance
- L/D
- rate of climb
- weight
- static margin
- wing span
- stall speed and CLmax
- design speed and CL -->

<h2 id="rubric">Rubric</h2>

<p>Design:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[5 pts] overall configuration choices are soundly justified.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] airfoil selection is soundly justified.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] wing design is soundly justified.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] predicted and measured weights are shown with discussion on how it affected the design if applicable.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] tail/canard sizing is soundly justified.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] a proper static and dynamic stability analysis is shown with discussion on how it affected the design.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] an analysis of the propulsion system is included.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] overall performance is shown with reasonable results (range, endurance, L/D, cruise speed and CL, CLmax, climb rate)</li>
  <li>[5 pts] fully dimensioned aircraft with 3 views are shown.</li>
</ul>

<p>Build:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[5 pts] evidence of an improved design through lessoned learned while building</li>
  <li>[5 pts] evidence of good building technique</li>
  <li>[5 pts] evidence of a built aircraft that (reasonably) matches the design</li>
</ul>

<p>Fly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[5 pts] evidence of good flight testing and observations from flight testing</li>
  <li>[5 pts] evidence of improvements made from flight testing</li>
  <li>[5 pts] evidence of good flight performance (videos or links to videos are welcome!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mission:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[5 pts] evidence of a reasonable computer strategy to direct pilot to waypoints.</li>
  <li>[15 pts] reached all 3 waypoints (reasonably directly) while respecting boundary and ceiling limits.  Plots shown and discussed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[5 pts] writing is clear.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] report is well organized.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] figures/data are nicely presented.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] level of detail is appropriate.</li>
  <li>[5 pts] good conclusions and reflections on the process
<!-- - \[5 pts\] overall report quality. --></li>
</ul>

<p>Extra Credit (levels, not cumulative):</p>
<ul>
  <li>[+5 pts] A proposed controller design</li>
  <li>[+10 pts] Evidence of successful ground-based or simulation-based testing</li>
  <li>[+40 pts] Successful mission with autopilot</li>
</ul>

<!-- - **35%**: Quality of aircraft design process.  Are the design choices reasonable and clearly justified?  Are the analyses technically sound?
- **30%**: Quality of report.  Is the writing clear and well organized?  Are figures/data presented clearly?  Does the information contain the important details while still being concise? 
- **20%**: Quality of built aircraft.  Is there evidence of good construction technique and improvements made?  Is there evidence of good flight testing and performance?
- **15%**: Mission performance.  How many waypoints were reached?  Did the aircraft stay within boundaries and altitude limits?  How long did it take to hit the waypoints? -->

<!-- Is there evidence of a good controls testing and development process (i.e., Gazebo and ground testing)? -->

<h2 id="peer-assessment">Peer Assessment</h2>

<p>Provide an assessment of the contribution level for yourself and the rest of your team members.  In the submission notes of Learning Suite, list each team memberâ€™s name including yourself, and next to each name list a number using the scale below.  You may provide additional comments if needed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>3: actively engaged.  strong contributions.</li>
  <li>2: somewhat engaged.  some contributions.</li>
  <li>1: not very engaged.  few contributions.</li>
</ul>
