      <h1 id="project">Project</h1>

<p>The goal of the project is to work as team to design, build, and fly an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle to complete a specified mission.</p>

<p><strong>Team</strong>: You will self-select a team of 5.  Choose one person to be a team lead.  Defining other roles of specialization is often helpful, but is at your discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong>: Using the provided components you will program an aircraft to fly autonomously through a set of specified waypoints.  The waypoints will be given as pairs of GPS lat, long coordinates with an 10 m allowable radius.  The aircraft must stay above 100 ft and below 400 ft relative to ground at all times (except during RC controlled landing when it can of course go lower).  The only sensor you will have is a GPS (actually your autopilot also has an altimeter, and an IMU with an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, but you won’t need any additional state information for this project).  Any code added to the autopilot must be written by a member of the team (i.e., you cannot use existing code).</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/fly_for_fun/">FAA guidelines</a> for model aircraft!  Remember, if the aircraft is drifting beyond sight, over people, or near other restricted areas/obstacles you must switch to RC mode and immediately fly back to safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Always</strong> be in the room when charging batteries.  They are a fire hazard if left unattended.</li>
  <li>Never drain a battery completely (i.e., don’t leave it plugged into your speed controller overnight).  Otherwise, it will no longer hold a charge.</li>
  <li>Don’t exceed 20 m/s ground speed at any time.</li>
  <li>Don’t fly when it is windy or gusty.  Early morning is often a good time to avoid wind.</li>
  <li>Double check that batteries are unplugged before swapping out a prop.  Keep your hands away from props anytime the aircraft is powered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flying</strong>: One or more of your team members may train to be a pilot if desired.  We have a flight simulator with a transmitter in the Airplane Lab that you can use to practice.  Alternatively, the TAs can fly for you, but you will need to arrange flying schedules with them.  The resources page contains information on how to certify as a pilot, as well as a pre-flight check list.</p>

<!-- New planes (or significantly modified existing planes) must be checked off with a TA before flying.  Bring the flight checklist with you and go through it before **every** flight.   -->

<p><strong>Design</strong>: The electronic components will be provided via a kit.  Everything else about the design is up to you!  Because the autopilot will be relatively basic, you will need to create a reasonably stable and efficient aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong>: We will provide a Raspberry Pi, flight controller, GPS unit, and receiver, all of which must be cared for and turned in at the end of class.  You will purchase (and keep) a kit of shorter-lasting components: speed controllers, motors, propellers, servos, push rods, etc.  You will also need to purchase supplies for the construction of your aircraft.  The nature of these materials is up to you but typical materials include foam, carbon rods, balsa or bass wood, 3D printing, etc.  In our workspace we will have various tools and adhesives available.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>: There will be a preliminary design review, a critical design review, and a final presentation.  Rubrics will be provided for each of these, and each has a low weight in points.  They are mostly milestones to make sure you are on target and to learn from one another.  There main deliverable is the final report.  Details on the final report are linked on the class schedule.</p>

<!-- You can make as many attempts as you want to complete the objective,  -->

<!-- are two main deliverables: the final report and the flyoff.  The report will be graded on xxxx.  Put the name(s) of the people who contributed to each section of the report.   -->

<!-- 50: completed mission
40: nearly completed mission, but either missed a waypoint or violated an altitude limit.
30: partial completion of mission
