<!-- ## Objective -->

<!-- To engage in deep learning of structural analysis, prepare you to be amongst the world’s most influential engineers, and build habits of lifelong learning. -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Overview</h2>

<p>This is a foundational course for mechanical engineers.  The material in this course will useful in a wide variety of engineering careers.  Even though I am an aerodynamicist, and not a structural engineer, I frequently use many concepts from this class in my work.  In brief, this class is about structural analysis: stress, deflection, failure, buckling, etc.  It builds on the foundational topics you were introduced to in CE EN 203, but with greater depth and more realistic applications.  A few new topics will be introduced including combined loading and failure theories.  Additionally, you will be introduced to finite element analysis (FEA) software, which is a powerful tool used heavily in many industries.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
  <li>CE EN 203 (required)</li>
  <li>ME EN 250 (required)</li>
  <li>ME EN 273 (highly recommended)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>1. Create appropriate machine design models that represent real structures and components.</p>

<p>2. Draw a free body diagram of a structure of machine component. Show the loads and calculate the reactions. Draw shear moment diagrams.</p>

<p>3. Calculate stress in machine components due to combined loadings.</p>

<p>4. Estimate the deflection of structural members under combined loading.</p>

<p>5. Select an appropriate static failure theory for a brittle or ductile material and apply it to predict failure loads and safety factors for various geometries and loading conditions.</p>

<p>6. Analyze the stresses in pressure vessels, press fits, curved beams, bolts, and bolted joints.</p>

<p>7. Calculate buckling predictions for statically loaded compression members.</p>

<p>8. Construct S-N and Goodman diagrams for cyclically loaded members, calculate mean and alternating stresses and predict safety factors for infinite or finite life.</p>

<p>9. Design machine members to prevent static, dynamic or fatigue failure. Integrate several components in a system to meet design requirements.</p>

<p>10. Gain experience using commercial FEA software to create models of simple structures and machine components. Solve these models to determine deflections and stresses, and understand how to interpret the results for engineering application.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-4">Course Content</h2>

<p>This course is organized around the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combined Loading on Beams (Axial, Bending, Shear, Torsion)</li>
  <li>Finite Element Analysis</li>
  <li>Deflection</li>
  <li>Beam Variants (Cylinders, Curved Beams, Beams with Nonsymmeric Cross Sections)</li>
  <li>Static Failure Theories</li>
  <li>Bolts</li>
  <li>Reliability</li>
  <li>Buckling</li>
  <li>Fatigue</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-5">Course Work</h2>

<p>Please keep in mind the level of time commitment expected (from the <a href="http://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2011-2012ucat/GeneralInfo/Registration.php">registrar’s office</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The expectation for undergraduate courses is three hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared; much more time may be required to achieve excellence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the <em>average</em> student will need to put in at least 6 hours of work outside of the classroom each week.</p>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>Good: attend class regularly and punctually.<br />
Better: attend and be attentive in class.<br />
Best: attend, be attentive, and <strong>actively participate</strong> in the classroom discussion.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask what you think might be a simple question, usually someone else is wondering the same thing and you are doing them a favor by asking.  Be respectful of your peers and arrive to class on time (but if you are late please don’t feel like you can’t come in).  You may use electronic devices in the classroom only if they are being used appropriately for class activities (e.g., taking notes).</p>

<p>Class time should not be a passive experience.  In addition to asking questions, you should come prepared to work on problems in class. I will often ask you to work individually or with small groups on example problems in class.  Many of these problems will be ones that you haven’t seen and don’t know how to solve.  That may be uncomfortable at first, but this practice will help you to learn concepts more deeply and become better engineering problem solvers.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Most class periods will have an assigned reading, and I expect you to complete the readings.  I cannot, not would it be effective to, cover all the content you need to know in class.  Instead, class time will be used for discussing difficult concepts, diving deeper into or expanding on concepts you were exposed to in your reading, answering questions, working examples together, and testing understanding.  Readings will come from <em>Shigley’s Mechanical Engineering Design</em> by Budynas and Nisbett (10th Ed.), as well as notes that I provide.</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>Homework will typically be due every Wednesday at midnight (actually 11:59pm).  Homework should be submitted electronically via Learning Suite.  Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 25% per day.  Last minute issues often happen in life so be sure to submit early!  Homework will involve a mix of traditional textbook problems, computational implementation and analysis, experimental data gathering and processing, and the use of finite element analysis software.</p>

<!-- We will grade the homework in a timely manner and provide you with feedback to assist in your learning. -->

<p>Homework will be primarily self-graded.  I will provided detailed solutions/guides, and you will assess your own work.  Reviewing your own work with a guided solution will help you better understand concepts you may have missed.  For some problems, you will also be given the opportunity to rework the problem.  Mistakes can be some of our most effective teachers, but to take advantage of the learning opportunity we must try again.</p>

<p>Assignments that just contain equations and solutions are insufficient and will not receive full credit.  Include the problem statement, list any assumptions, describe the methodology, discuss any results or conclusions, and reference any data or information you use.  Your audience is a colleague or supervisor—someone who understands your field but is not necessarily familiar with the details of your particular problem.  This practice will enable you to better communicate your work to others, and enable you to understand what you did when referring to your own work later.</p>

<!-- Assignments are expected to be produced in report format.  A series of equations and "solutions" is insufficient.  Each report should introduce the problem and any assumptions, detail the methodology, and discuss the results and conclusions.  Use full sentences, not bullet points.  Imagine your audience to be a colleague or supervisor&mdash;someone who understands your field but is not necessarily familiar with the details of your particular problem.  Why a report format?  You will learn deeper by having to explain in words, you will improve your writing skills, it will better prepare you for the type of work you will have in an engineering career, and the hard work you did will be much more accessible to you when referring to it later.   -->

<p>Working with others on homework is certainly encouraged, but you must prepare your own reports.  <strong>Referring to solution manuals or homework from prior students is a violation of the honor code.</strong></p>

<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>

<p>There will be a weekly lab led by a teaching assistant.  The labs will help you gain familiarity with ANSYS and will complement concepts you are learning in the lecture. Some labs will involving using test equipment. If you attend each lab, and are attentive, most of the time you should be able to complete the lab assignment within the allocated lab hours. Labs will be due the following week before the lab begins. During the last few weeks of the lab you will work on a larger final project using ANSYS.</p>

<h3 id="quizzes-and-exams">Quizzes and Exams</h3>

<p>There will be frequent quizzes to engage your thinking on important concepts, assess your understanding, and practice for the exams.  There will be two midterm exams and one comprehensive final exam.</p>

<!-- Quizzes will be partially graded for correctness and partially for participation.   -->

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>An approximate percent breakdown is as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Homework and Labs</td>
      <td>50%</td>
    </tr>

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>

<p>The TAs and I hold office hours, and want to make ourselves as available as possible.  Office hours will be much less effective if you go in expecting to see homework problems worked out for you. This will rob you of much of the learning the problem was designed for.  Even asking for examples of similar problems is usually not the best place to begin if your objective is real learning.  The most effective engineers, and the most exciting and rewarding careers, will involve solving problems that are unlike those anyone has solved before.  The goal of office hours (and homework) is to help you to that end.  In other words, we are less interested in getting to “solutions”, and more interesting in developing problem skills and engineering understanding.</p>

<p>Instead of asking how to solve the problem or to see a related example, describe where you are stuck and what you think you need help with, ask questions on concepts you don’t understand, brainstorm ideas on how to move forward and ask for feedback, try things and don’t be afraid to fail.  On some problems you may feel like you don’t know where to begin and don’t even know what questions to ask.  Simplify the problem and make at least one attempt even if it seems horribly wrong.  Be prepared for the TA or I to ask you lots of questions to probe understanding and help guide you in the discovery process.  After wrestling with the problem and discussing concepts for a while, working out related examples or parts of the homework problem together is entirely appropriate, but this shouldn’t be the starting place.</p>

<p>In addition to normal office hours, we use Piazza to assist you in asking for and giving help.  Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates, the TA, and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza.  After signing up for an account, you may want to visit your notification preferences.</p>

<h3 id="advice">Advice</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Complete the readings.</li>
  <li>Participate in class discussions.</li>
  <li>Start early on the homework.</li>
  <li>Work with others.</li>
  <li>Ask questions.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Two things you'll quickly learn as you move into your first job, if you haven't learned them already, is that there is rarely a "right answer", and working well with others is essential.  Excellent engineers take the time to deeply understand the problem before trying to find solutions, are able to clearly justify their selected methodology, and can carefully present their findings.  Learn from and help your peers.  Get to know the TAs and the instructor in office hours.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.  

Strong technical writing skills will be vital in your career and are often under-appreciated by engineering students.  Take advantage of opportunities to practice your writing and oral communication skills and learn how to express ideas clearly.  Scientific programming skills are also highly valued.  Many students understand syntax, but fewer can debug effectively and organize code clearly and logically.  

Worry less about grades and more about learning.  Have fun!  Find things that interest you and take the initiative to dive deeper! -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-6">University Policies</h2>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university’s expectation, and every instructor’s expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-sexual-misconduct">Preventing Sexual Misconduct</h3>

<p>As required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the university prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual harassment—including sexual violence—committed by or against students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of “Sexual Misconduct” prohibited by the university.</p>

<p>University policy requires any university employee in a teaching, managerial, or supervisory role to report incidents of Sexual Misconduct that come to their attention through various forms including face-to-face conversation, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. If you encounter Sexual Misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or 801-422-2130 or Ethics Point at https://titleix.byu.edu/report-concern or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours). Additional information about Title IX and resources available to you can be found at titleix.byu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="student-disability">Student Disability</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 422-2767. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895, D-285 ASB.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to “be honest.” Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life’s work, but also to build character. “President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education” (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="devotional-attendance">Devotional Attendance</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University’s devotional and forum assemblies are an important part of your BYU experience. President Cecil O. Samuelson said, “We have special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies…that will complement, supplement, and enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday…and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you…A large part of what constitutes the unique ‘BYU experience’ is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus” (from the address “The Legacy of Learning”, 30 August, 2005). Your attendance at each forum and devotional is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="inappropriate-use-of-course-materials">Inappropriate Use Of Course Materials</h3>

<p>All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another’s words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgement, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author’s own. Plagiarism Mosaic-The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one’s own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student’s work and submitting it as one’s own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.</p>
