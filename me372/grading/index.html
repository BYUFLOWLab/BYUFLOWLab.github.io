<p>You will grade your own homework using the solutions and rubric I provide.  The grader will spot check certain problems to help ensure grading is applied appropriately and consistently.</p>

<p>Each homework is due Wednesday before midnight and is worth 45 points.  Solutions will then be posted and you will then have two days to grade your homework (due Friday before midnight). You will receive 5 points for grading your work, reading the solutions, and reworking/learning anything you missed.  In order to receive the grading credit you must rework/review/etc. the parts you missed until you understand. You must also read through all of the solutions even if you got everything right.  Seeing other ways of solving problems or other ways of presenting solutions is instructive.  You do not need to rework entire problems from the beginning, just make sure you do enough to fully understand anything you missed.</p>

<p>Late homework is deducted at 25% per day (on your honor not to look at solutions until you submit your homework).  If your grading submission is late you will lose the grading points (5 pts), but can still receive the points for your homework.</p>

<p>A few different symbols are used as shorthand in the grading rubrics.  Their definitions are detailed below.</p>

<h3 id="pt-scale">[4 pt scale]</h3>

<ul>
  <li>4 pts: All concepts were understood, answers were correct, and all asked for elements of the problem were provided.</li>
  <li>3 pts: Correct except for a minor computational or plotting error.</li>
  <li>2 pts: Minor conceptual error(s).</li>
  <li>1 pts: Major conceptual error(s).</li>
  <li>0 pts: No effort.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pt-scale-1">[2 pt scale]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 pts: Fully correct.</li>
  <li>1 pts: Correct except for a minor computational mistake.</li>
  <li>0 pts: Conceptual errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="x-pts">[0â€“X pts]</h3>
<p>Assign an appropriate number of points between 0 and X accordingly to how much of the task you completed (i.e., partial credit allowed).</p>

<h3 id="x-pts-1">[X pts]</h3>
<p>You can only receive all of the points or 0 (i.e., no partial credit).</p>

<h3 id="x-pts-2">[+X pts]</h3>
<p>Add X pts to the current total if the task was completed.</p>
