<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Objective</h2>

<p>To engage in deep learning of optimization principles, be able to effectively setup and solve real-world optimization problems, and develop technical and communication skills to prepare you to be amongst the world’s most influential engineers.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">Overview</h2>

<p>Optimization consists of finding the best feasible selection amongst competing alternatives.  Optimization methods are used in a wide range of applications including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>design</strong>: designing the shape of a car for minimum drag</li>
  <li><strong>controls</strong>: selecting the best actuation sequence of a robot to minimize expended energy</li>
  <li><strong>resource allocation</strong>: deciding what quantities of material to send to which stores to maximize production</li>
  <li><strong>trajectory planning</strong>: finding the best path for a UAV to maximize its observable area</li>
  <li><strong>regression</strong>: finding the best curve parameters to describe the data</li>
  <li><strong>physics simulation</strong>: finding the shape of a hanging chain that minimizes potential energy</li>
  <li><strong>machine learning</strong>: determining model parameters to predict Netflix movies you are likely to be interested in</li>
  <li>and many others…</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no one optimization algorithm to rule them all, so in this class we will learn about several different classes of algorithms.  You will learn the strengths and limitations of different approaches, and how to frame your analysis in a way that is “optimization-friendly”.  Optimization almost always involves complicated tradeoffs, and computers are useful in managing this complexity and extracting insight.</p>

<p>What you take away from the course will greatly depend on your attitude, diligence, initiative, and willingness to work with and learn from others.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
  <li>multivariable calculus</li>
  <li>linear algebra</li>
  <li>computer programming</li>
</ul>

<p>This course assumes no prior exposure to optimization, but you will need a foundation in mathematics and programming.</p>

<p>
   <strong>What math concepts should I review?</strong>
</p>

<p>The main concepts you should review from multivariable calculus are partial derivatives, the chain rule, directional derivatives, and the gradient for multivariable functions.  For linear algebra <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf">here</a> is a good review.  Almost every concept in this PDF is one we will use at some point this semester.</p>

<p>
   <strong>How much programming experience do I need to take this class?</strong>
</p>

<p>You should be familiar and comfortable with the basics: functions, loops, conditionals, variable types, arrays (vectors), use of numerical libraries.  Familiarity with object oriented programming is not necessary.  It does not matter too much what language(s) you have experience with as long as you understand the fundamentals.  This year we will use <strong>Matlab</strong>.  The concepts you learn in this course are translatable to other programming languages or optimization packages.</p>

<!-- In this class you can choose to use either **Matlab** or **Python**. -->

<p>While this is not a programming course, many of the concepts are best learned through implementation.  Some of these algorithms are involved and optimization methods are great at exploiting any errors or weakness in implementation.  You will need to develop and refine your skills in code debugging as well as in physical insight.  I <strong>do not</strong> recommend taking this class if you do not have programming experience.  It will be very difficult to get up to speed with programming and stay on top of the optimization concepts at the same time.  Note that programming experience need not necessarily come from a formal course.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Can I take this class as an undergraduate?</strong>
</p>

<p>Definitely.  Many undergraduates elect to take this course and do very well, but keep in mind that this is a graduate course and expectations will be consistent with graduate-level work.  Also, the course project is often (but not always) most effective when applied to an ongoing research project.  If you are not involved in research, you may want to join a team with a graduate student.  As compared to an undergraduate class:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the workload is higher (more time required).</li>
  <li>the problems are more difficult and require more open-ended problem solving and debugging skills.</li>
  <li>the homeworks are more like reports—you need to explain your methodology and results and not just “circle your answer”.</li>
  <li>you need to be more of an independent learner (set your own reading schedule, break up larger assignments and projects, find and use outside resources, etc.).</li>
  <li>the required level of mathematical understanding is higher.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-4">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-6">Course Work</h2>

<!-- Course content is designed to adhere to the guidelines from the [registrar's office](https://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2015-2016ucat/GeneralInfo/Registration.php):
> three hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared; much more time may be required to achieve excellence.  
 -->

<p>A higher workload is expected in graduate courses as compared to undergradaute courses.  As a rule of thumb you should plan on four hours of work per week per credit hour.  Subtracting class time, that means at least 9.5 hours of work outside of class each week.</p>

<!-- The homeworks are designed with two week deadlines, meaning each homework represents about 18 hours of work (including reading and project time). -->

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>Good: attend class regularly and punctually.<br />
Better: attend and be attentive in class.<br />
Best: attend, be attentive, and <strong>actively participate</strong> in the classroom discussion.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask what you think might be a simple question, usually someone else is wondering the same thing and you are doing them a favor by asking.  Be respectful of your peers and arrive to class on time (but if you are late please don’t feel like you can’t come in).  You may use electronic devices in the classroom only if they are being used appropriately for class activities (e.g., taking notes).</p>

<p>Class time should not be a passive experience.  In addition to asking questions, you should come prepared to work on problems in class. I will often ask you to work individually or with small groups on example problems in class.  Many of these problems will be ones that you haven’t seen and don’t know how to solve.  That may be uncomfortable at first, but this practice will help you to learn concepts more deeply and become better engineering problem solvers.</p>

<p>I provide slides for each lecture.  They are intentionally sparse.  Studies suggest that you will learn and retain information better by taking notes, so I intentionally avoid providing you with detailed notes.  On the other hand, requiring you to copy down lots of information won’t give you space to think in class.  The goal of the slides is to hopefully reach a happy medium.  The lecture slides are used to provide organization and display items that would be time consuming to write down (e.g., images, long equations).  Important details are elaborated on in class, and it is expected that you will be taking good notes.  Some students like to use the slides as a background to write their notes on.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>All topics have associated reading, and I expect you to complete readings before class.  I cannot, not would it be effective to, cover all the content you need to know in class.  Instead, class time will be used for discussing difficult concepts, diving deeper into or expanding on concepts you were exposed to in your reading, answering questions, working examples together, and testing understanding.  Readings will come from <a href="http://flowlab.groups.et.byu.net/me575/textbook/MDO.pdf"><em>Multidisciplinary Design Optimization</em> (29 MB)</a> by Joaquim R. R. A. Martins, Andrew Ning, and Jason Hicken.</p>

<p>Optional textbooks for the interested learner are also listed under <a href="../resources">Resources</a>.</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>There are six homeworks designed to teach the important concepts in the class and to help you succeed on your project and future optimization problems.  Each homework will be assigned two weeks before its due date and will be submitted in the form of a short report via Learning Suite.  Homework will typically be due every Wednesday at midnight (actually 11:59pm) and will be turned in via Learning Suite.  Homework submission guidelines are linked from the schedule page (<a href="../schedule/guidelines">direct link</a>).  Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 25% per day.  Last minute issues often happen in life so be sure to start your work early and submit early!</p>

<!-- Because of the 2-week time frame, I expect you to plan ahead and so late homework will not be accepted (except with prior approval for extreme extenuating circumstances)<sup>1</sup>.  We will grade the homework in a timely manner and provide you with feedback to assist in your learning.  Homework submission details are provided in the [Assignments](../assignments) section. -->

<p>Homework will be primarily self-graded.  I will provided detailed solutions/guides, and you will assess your own work.  Reviewing your own work with a guided solution will help you better understand concepts you may have missed, and will allow you to see alternative solution approaches.  Mistakes can be some of our most effective teachers, but to take advantage of the learning opportunity we must review our work, figure out what the mistake was, and learn how to address it.  The grader will spot check certain problems to help ensure grading is applied appropriately and consistently, and to provide feedback on things where more experience is required.</p>

<!-- For some problems, you will also be given the opportunity to rework the problem.   -->

<!-- We will grade the homework in a timely manner and provide you with feedback to assist in your learning. -->

<p>Working with others on homework is certainly encouraged, but you must do your own work and prepare your own reports.  <strong>Use of solutions, homework, or exams from prior students or other sources is a violation of the honor code.</strong></p>

<!-- <span style="font-size: 80%;"><sup>1</sup> Most of you will deal with something this semester: an illness, extracurricular events, scientific conferences, job interviews, midterms, family events, an exceptionally busy week, etc. Many of these will even be unexpected.  These are not valid reasons for an extension.  With a two week deadline I expect you to plan ahead and start early.  Valid reasons for extension are things like hospitalization, prolonged serious illness, death in the family, birth of a child (let me know in advance).  My goal isn't to be harsh, but to help you adjust to the realities of real-world deadlines and improve in your project/time management skills.  I don't like having to enforce deadlines, but I do you a disservice in your career preparation by letting things slide.  I want to help you succeed not just in this class, but in your life in general.</span> -->

<!-- <span style="font-size: 80%;"> -->
<!-- Also, do not wait until the very last minute to try to submit.  Learning Suite will not let you submit after midnight (actually 11:59 pm).  Some students plan their schedule so that they are working on assignments all the way up to the last minute.  It's not uncommon to have computer/internet/other last minute problems and these are not valid reasons to submit late.  I'm not going to be so harsh that I will turn away your assignment if you have to email it to me a few minutes late, but you will lose points and it won't be worth it.  Just submit with plenty of time to spare. -->
<!-- </span> -->

<!-- I suggest getting things done early to minimize last minute surprises.   -->
<!-- Some students struggle with the transition to the workplace because these skills are underdeveloped.   -->

<h3 id="project">Project</h3>

<p>The main thrust of this course is a semester-long project that will allow you to dive deeper into an area or application that you are interested in.  The project is open-ended and you will work in small groups of size 2-3.  The end product will be a report (of typical journal paper length) appropriately formatted and describing the problem, your methodology, the results, and your conclusions.  Excellent projects will result in publishable or nearly-publishable work.</p>

<p>Your project may be aligned with research you are doing outside of the classroom (in fact I recommend doing so if possible).  The milestones within the project will consist of a short abstract due early in the semester, an extended outline due about a month before the end of the semester, an in-class presentation, and a final report due on the last day of class.  More details on the project are found <a href="../schedule/project-guidelines/">here</a>.  Example project reports from past classes can be found on the <a href="../resources">Resources</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="quizzes-and-exams">Quizzes and Exams</h3>

<p>There will be a weekly quiz to engage your thinking on important concepts, assess your understanding, and practice for the exam.  There will also be a comprehensive final exam.</p>

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>

<p>The TA and I both hold office hours, and want to make ourselves as available as possible.  Office hours will be much less effective if you go in expecting to see homework problems worked out for you. This will rob you of much of the learning the problem was designed for.  The most effective engineers, and the most exciting and rewarding careers, will involve solving problems that are unlike those anyone has solved before.  The goal of office hours (and homework) is to help you to that end.  In other words, we are less interested in getting to “solutions”, and more interesting in developing problem skills and engineering understanding.</p>

<!-- Even asking for examples of similar problems is usually not the best place to begin if your objective is real learning.   -->

<!-- Instead of asking how to solve the problem or to see a related example, describe where you are stuck and what you think you need help with, ask questions on concepts you don't understand, brainstorm ideas on how to move forward and ask for feedback, try things and don't be afraid to fail.  On some problems you may feel like you don't know where to begin and don't even know what questions to ask.  Simplify the problem and make at least one attempt even if it seems horribly wrong.  Be prepared for the TA or I to ask you lots of questions to probe understanding and help guide you in the discovery process.  After wrestling with the problem and discussing concepts for a while, working out related examples or parts of the homework problem together is entirely appropriate, but this shouldn't be the starting place. -->

<p>In addition to normal office hours, we use Piazza to assist you in asking for and giving help.  Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates, the TA, and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza.  After signing up for an account, you may want to visit your notification preferences.  I prefer batch notifications.</p>

<!-- Finally, we will have a weekly TA-led recitation section.  In this session we will review concepts, work through examples, demonstrate Star-CCM+ tasks, and answer questions.  Attendance is optional.  We try to anticipate common problems/questions to discuss in the session, and answer the questions that you bring.  The primary focus of these sessions will be Star-CCM+ examples to help you with the homework assignments. -->

<h3 id="advice">Advice</h3>

<p>Each homework is assigned two weeks before the deadline because it is designed to take that long.  Plan your time well. If you put off most of the work until a few days before the deadline you will not be as successful.  Some of you will struggle with the scheduling format because you are used to homeworks and readings being divided into smaller chunks for you.  This is a graduate class and I expect you to be able to do your own task management.  As you prepare for the workplace this is a critical skill to develop.</p>

<p>Debugging is one of the most challenging parts of optimization.  Your level of skill with debugging will often be correlated with how long it takes you to complete the homeworks.  There are two aspects of debugging in this context: coding implementation and problem formulation.</p>

<p>The first aspect to debugging is to make sure your code is implemented correctly.  This challenge is common to any programming work.  I suggest that you start simple and test frequently.  Even though it may seem slower to stop and test as you go, it will save you lots of time in the end.  Break algorithms into small pieces.  Determine what the expected output should be for a small piece and thoroughly test it before adding more functionality.  Test boundary cases as well.  Learn how to step line by line through your code, plot outputs, etc.  Formalizing this process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>.</p>

<p>The second aspect is to appropriately formulate your optimization problem, particularly in your project.  Is your objective function suitable?  Is there a better higher-level objective?  Should your objective actually be a constraint?  Are there other important constraints that you have not considered?  What do you expect the solution to be?  How does the starting point affect your solution?  Have you explored the scaling of the problem?  Can you decompose your problem into a smaller problem to build on (i.e., start with just a few design variables at first, remove some constraints).  Have you explored the behavior of all outputs with respect to all inputs?  Did you provide gradients, and if so did you run a gradient check?  Have you looked at the output messages from the optimizer?</p>

<!-- Two things you'll quickly learn as you move into your first job, if you haven't learned them already, is that there is rarely a "right answer", and working well with others is essential.  Excellent engineers take the time to deeply understand the problem before trying to find solutions, are able to clearly justify their selected methodology, and can carefully present their findings.  Learn from and help your peers.  Get to know the TAs and the instructor in office hours.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.   -->

<!-- Focus less on reaching a preconceived final answer and focus more on understanding the process.   -->

<!-- Strong technical writing skills will be vital in your career and are often under-appreciated by engineering students.  Take advantage of opportunities to practice your writing and oral communication skills and learn how to express ideas clearly.  Scientific programming skills are also highly valued.  Many students understand syntax, but fewer can debug effectively and organize code clearly and logically.   -->

<!-- Worry less about grades and more about learning.  Have fun!  Find things that interest you and take the initiative to dive deeper! -->

<!-- ### Piazza -->

<!-- To assist you in asking for and giving help, we will be using Piazza. Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates, the TA, and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza (we will still have office hours as well).  After signing up for an account, you may want to visit your notification preferences.  Use of Piazza is optional but highly recommended.  All important class announcements will come through Learning Suite, but homework discussion and homework help will all be done through Piazza.   -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-7">University Policies</h2>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university’s expectation, and every instructor’s expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-sexual-misconduct">Preventing Sexual Misconduct</h3>

<p>As required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the university prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual harassment—including sexual violence—committed by or against students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of “Sexual Misconduct” prohibited by the university.</p>

<p>University policy requires any university employee in a teaching, managerial, or supervisory role to report incidents of Sexual Misconduct that come to their attention through various forms including face-to-face conversation, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. If you encounter Sexual Misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or 801-422-2130 or Ethics Point at https://titleix.byu.edu/report-concern or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours). Additional information about Title IX and resources available to you can be found at titleix.byu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="student-disability">Student Disability</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 422-2767. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895, D-285 ASB.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to “be honest.” Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life’s work, but also to build character. “President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education” (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="devotional-attendance">Devotional Attendance</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University’s devotional and forum assemblies are an important part of your BYU experience. President Cecil O. Samuelson said, “We have special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies…that will complement, supplement, and enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday…and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you…A large part of what constitutes the unique ‘BYU experience’ is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus” (from the address “The Legacy of Learning”, 30 August, 2005). Your attendance at each forum and devotional is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="inappropriate-use-of-course-materials">Inappropriate Use Of Course Materials</h3>

<p>All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another’s words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgement, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author’s own. Plagiarism Mosaic-The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one’s own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student’s work and submitting it as one’s own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.</p>
