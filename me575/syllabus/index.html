<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Objective</h2>

<p>To engage in deep learning of optimization principles, be able to effectively setup and solve real-world optimization problems, and develop technical and communication skills to prepare you to be amongst the world's most influential engineers.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">Overview</h2>

<p>Optimization consists of finding the best feasible selection amongst competing alternatives.  Optimization methods are used in a wide range of applications including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>design</strong>: designing the shape of a car for minimum drag</li>
<li><strong>controls</strong>: selecting the best actuation sequence of a robot to minimize expended energy</li>
<li><strong>resource allocation</strong>: deciding what quantities of material to send to which stores to maximize production</li>
<li><strong>trajectory planning</strong>: finding the best path for a UAV to maximize its observable area</li>
<li><strong>regression</strong>: finding the best curve parameters to describe the data</li>
<li><strong>physics simulation</strong>: finding the shape of a hanging chain that minimizes potential energy</li>
<li><strong>machine learning</strong>: determining model parameters to predict Netflix movies you are likely to be interested in</li>
<li>and many others...</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no one optimization algorithm to rule them all, so in this class we will learn about several different classes of algorithms.  You will learn the strengths and limitations of different approaches, and how to frame your analysis in a way that is "optimization-friendly".  Optimization almost always involves complicated tradeoffs, and computers are useful in managing this complexity and extracting insight.</p>

<p>What you take away from the course will greatly depend on your attitude, diligence, initiative, and willingness to work with and learn from others.  While many undergraduates elect to take this course and do very well, keep in mind that this is a graduate course and expectations will be consistent with graduate-level work.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>multivariable calculus</li>
<li>linear algebra</li>
<li>computer programming</li>
</ul>

<p>This course assumes no prior exposure to optimization, but you will need a foundation in mathematics and programming.</p>

<p>
   <strong>What math concepts should I review?</strong>
</p>

<p>The main concepts you should review from multivariable calculus are partial derivatives, the chain rule, directional derivatives, and the gradient for multivariable functions.  For linear algebra <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf">here</a> is a good review.  Almost every concept in this PDF is one we will use at some point this semester.  </p>

<p>
   <strong>How much programming experience do I need to take this class?</strong>
</p>

<p>You should be familiar and comfortable with the basics: functions, loops, conditionals, variable types, arrays (vectors), use of numerical libraries.  Familiarity with object oriented programming is not necessary.  It does not matter too much what language(s) you have experience with as long as you understand the fundamentals.  In this class you can choose to use either <strong>Matlab</strong> or <strong>Python</strong>.  The concepts you learn in this course are translatable to other programming languages or optimization packages.</p>

<p>While this is not a programming course, many of the concepts are best learned through implementation.  Some of these algorithms are involved and optimization methods are great at exploiting any errors or weakness in implementation.  You will need to develop and refine your skills in code debugging as well as in physical insight.  I <strong>do not</strong> recommend taking this class if you do not have any programming experience.  It will be very difficult to get up to speed with programming and stay on top of the optimization concepts at the same time.  Note that programming experience need not necessarily come from a formal course.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-4">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>
   <strong>Define and Use Optimization Terminology and Concepts</strong>
</p>

<p>Define and use optimization terminology and concepts, and understand how to classify an optimization problem.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Application of Optimization Methods to Engineering Problems</strong>
</p>

<p>Apply optimization methods to engineering problems, including developing a model, defining an optimization problem, applying optimization methods, exploring the solution, and interpreting results.  Students will demonstrate the ability to choose and justify optimization techniques that are appropriate for solving realistic engineering problems.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Unconstrained Optimization Theory for Continuous Problems</strong>
</p>

<p>Understand and apply unconstrained optimization theory for continuous problems, including the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and algorithms such as: steepest descent, Newton’s method, conjugate gradient, and quasi-Newton methods.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Computing Derivatives for Gradient-based Optimization</strong>
</p>

<p>Understand and apply methods for computing derivatives such as: finite differencing, symbolic differentiation, complex step, algorithmic differentiation, and analytic methods (direct and adjoint).</p>

<p>
   <strong>Gradient-free and Discrete Optimization Algorithms</strong>
</p>

<p>
   <strong>Constrained Optimization Theory for Continuous Problems</strong>
</p>

<p>Understand and apply constrained optimization theory for continuous problems, including the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and algorithms such as: generalized reduced gradient, sequential quadratic programming, and interior-point methods.</p>

<p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-6">Course Work</h2>

<p>Course content is designed to adhere to the guidelines from the <a href="https://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2015-2016ucat/GeneralInfo/Registration.php">registrar's office</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>three hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared; much more time may be required to achieve excellence.  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>Good: attend class regularly and punctually.<br />
Better: attend and be attentive in class.<br />
Best: attend, be attentive, and <strong>actively participate</strong> in the classroom discussion.  </p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask what you think might be a simple question, usually someone else is wondering the same thing and you are doing them a favor by asking.  Be respectful of your peers and arrive to class on time (but if you are late please don't feel like you can't come in).  If you must be absent, ask a friend to take notes for you.  You may use electronic devices in the classroom only if they are being used appropriately for class activities (e.g., taking notes).  </p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>Required reading will come from the course text "Multidisciplinary Design Optimization" by Joaquim R. R. A. Martins, Andrew Ning, and Jason Hicken.  The chapters from the text are available under <a href="../resources">Resources</a>.  If you notice errors in the text do let me know.</p>

<p>I expect you to read the textbook.  I cannot, not would it be effective to, cover all the content you need to know in class.  Instead, class time will be used for discussing difficult concepts, diving deeper into or expanding on concepts you were exposed to in your reading, answering questions, working examples together, and testing understanding.  </p>

<p>Optional textbooks for the interested learner are also listed under <a href="../resources">Resources</a>.</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>There will be six homeworks designed to teach the important concepts in the class and to help you succeed on your project and future optimization problems.  Each homework will be assigned two weeks before its due date and will be submitted in the form of a short report via Learning Suite.  Because of the 2-week time frame, I expect you to plan ahead and so late homework will not be accepted (except with prior approval for extreme extenuating circumstances).  We will grade the homework in a timely manner and provide you with feedback to assist in your learning.  Homework submission details are provided in the <a href="../assignments">Assignments</a> section.</p>

<p>Working with others on homework is certainly encouraged, but you must do your own work and prepare your own reports.  <strong>Use of solution manuals or homework from prior students is a violation of the honor code.</strong></p>

<h3 id="project">Project</h3>

<p>The main thrust of this course is a semester-long project that will allow you to dive deeper into an area or application that you are interested in.  The project is open-ended and you will work in small groups of size 2-3.  The end product will be a report (of typical journal paper length) appropriately formated and describing the problem, your methodology, the results, and your conclusions.  Excellent projects will result in publishable or nearly-publishable work.  </p>

<p>Your project may be aligned with research you are doing outside of the classroom (in fact I recommend doing so if possible).  The milestones within the project will consist of a short abstract due early in the semester, an extended outline due about a month before the end of the semester, an in-class presentation, and a final report due on the last day of class.  More details on the project are found in the <a href="../assignments">Assignments</a> section.  Example project reports from past classes can be found on our course website.</p>

<h3 id="quizzes-and-exams">Quizzes and Exams</h3>

<p>There will be a weekly quiz (closed-book, closed-notes) to engage your thinking on important concepts, assess your understanding, and practice for the exam.  There will also be a comprehensive final exam.  </p>

<h3 id="advice">Advice</h3>

<p>Each homework is assigned two weeks before the deadline because it is designed to take that long.  Plan your time well. If you put off most of the work until a few days before the deadline you will not be as successful.  Some of you will struggle with the scheduling format because you are used to homeworks and readings being divided into smaller chunks for you.  This is a graduate class and I expect you to be able to do your own task management.  As you prepare for the workplace this is a critical skill to develop.</p>

<p>Debugging is one of the most challenging parts of optimization.  Your level of skill with debugging will often be correlated with how long it takes you to complete the homeworks.  There are two aspects of debugging in this context: coding implementation and problem formulation.</p>

<p>The first aspect to debugging is to make sure your code is implemented correctly.  This challenge is common to any programming work.  I suggest that you start simple and test frequently.  Even though it may seem slower to stop and test as you go, it will save you lots of time in the end.  Break algorithms into small pieces.  Determine what the expected output should be for a small piece and thoroughly test it before adding more functionality.  Test boundary cases as well.  Learn how to step line by line through your code, plot outputs, etc.  Formalizing this process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>.</p>

<p>The second aspect is to appropriately formulate your optimization problem.  Is your objective function suitable?  Is there a better higher-level objective?  Should your objective actually be a constraint?  Are there other important constraints that you have not considered?  What do you expect the solution to be?  How does the starting point affect your solution?  Have you explored  the scaling of the problem?  Can you decompose your problem into a smaller problem to build on (i.e., start with just a few design variables at first, remove some constraints).  Have you explored the behavior of all outputs with respect to all inputs?  Did you provide gradients, and if so did you run a gradient check?  Have you looked at the output messages from the optimizer?</p>

<!-- Two things you'll quickly learn as you move into your first job, if you haven't learned them already, is that there is rarely a "right answer", and working well with others is essential.  Excellent engineers take the time to deeply understand the problem before trying to find solutions, are able to clearly justify their selected methodology, and can carefully present their findings.  Learn from and help your peers.  Get to know the TAs and the instructor in office hours.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.   -->

<!-- Focus less on reaching a preconceived final answer and focus more on understanding the process.   -->

<!-- Strong technical writing skills will be vital in your career and are often under-appreciated by engineering students.  Take advantage of opportunities to practice your writing and oral communication skills and learn how to express ideas clearly.  Scientific programming skills are also highly valued.  Many students understand syntax, but fewer can debug effectively and organize code clearly and logically.   -->

<!-- Worry less about grades and more about learning.  Have fun!  Find things that interest you and take the initiative to dive deeper! -->

<h3 id="piazza">Piazza</h3>

<p>To assist you in asking for and giving help, we will be using Piazza. Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates, the TA, and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza (we will still have office hours as well).  After signing up for an account, you may want to visit your notification preferences.  Use of Piazza is optional but highly recommended.  All important class announcements will come through Learning Suite, but homework discussion and homework help will all be done through Piazza.  </p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-7">Schedule</h2>

<p>Please see Learning Suite for the current schedule.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-8">University Policies</h2>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and every instructor's expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

<h3 id="sexual-harassment">Sexual Harassment</h3>

<p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in an educational program or activity that receives federal funds. The act is intended to eliminate sex discrimination in education and pertains to admissions, academic and athletic programs, and university-sponsored activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual harassment of students by university employees, other students, and visitors to campus. If you encounter sexual harassment or gender-based discrimination, please talk to your professor or contact one of the following: the Title IX Coordinator at 801-422-2130; the Honor Code Office at 801-422-2847; the Equal Employment Office at 801-422-5895; or Ethics Point at <a href="http://www.ethicspoint.com">http://www.ethicspoint.com</a>, or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours).</p>

<h3 id="student-disability">Student Disability</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 422-2767. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895, D-285 ASB.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to "be honest." Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life's work, but also to build character. "President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education" (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="devotional-attendance">Devotional Attendance</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University's devotional and forum assemblies are an important part of your BYU experience. President Cecil O. Samuelson said, "We have special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies...that will complement, supplement, and enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday...and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you...A large part of what constitutes the unique 'BYU experience' is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus" (from the address "The Legacy of Learning", 30 August, 2005). Your attendance at each forum and devotional is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="inappropriate-use-of-course-materials">Inappropriate Use Of Course Materials</h3>

<p>All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one's own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgement, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author's own. Plagiarism Mosaic-The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one's own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student's work and submitting it as one's own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.</p>
