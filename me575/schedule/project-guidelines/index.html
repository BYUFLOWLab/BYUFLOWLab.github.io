<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Overview</h2>

<p>One of the primary goals of this course is to prepare you to understand and apply state-of-the-art optimization algorithms to applications in research and industry.  The final project is an opportunity for you to explore an area of interest, and to develop and demonstrate deeper understanding.  The milestones for the project are list below (check syllabus for specific dates).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> about 3 weeks from start of semester</li>
  <li><strong>Draft Report:</strong> about 3 weeks before end of semester</li>
  <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> during last week of class</li>
  <li><strong>Final Report:</strong>  last day of class</li>
</ul>

<!-- - **Abstract:** due Jan 27 by midnight
- **Draft report:** due Mar 23 by midnight
- **Presentation:** Last week of class
- **Final Report:**  due Apr 12 by midnight -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">Topic</h2>

<p>The project is open-ended as long as it is related to the subject material of the class.  If you need help brainstorming ideas please talk to Dr. Ning, the TA, or your advisor.  Your project may involve applying existing optimization algorithms to an application of interest, developing novel optimization strategies or algorithms, or extending studies from past projects.</p>

<p>Explore previously published research papers in your field of interest for inspiration.  If you are involved in research outside of the classroom, you may consider a project applying optimization to a part of your existing research efforts.  Keep in mind, you can only receive credit for work you do this semester.  Tying this project in with your research is encouraged but certainly not necessary.  The most important criteria is to pick a topic that you are excited about.  Don’t be afraid to be ambitious!</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">Collaboration</h2>

<p>You will work in teams of size two or three.  Collaboration skills are critically important in engineering.  You may work individually only if it is supporting your individual ongoing research project and does not lend itself well to additional collaboration.  In this case, please email me to obtain approval for an individual project.  To be clear, working on an ongoing research project does not necessitate working individually.</p>

<p>When forming teams make sure your project is properly scoped for the team size.  Larger teams need a larger (usually deeper) scope.  It’s usually best if each person has an equal but different role that they can take ownership on.  This is especially important if tying in with one of the team member’s existing research.  One challenge some 3-person teams have faced is not identifying separate contribution areas up front leading to one or two of the members doing most of the work.  Three person teams usually increase scope by adding disciplines (e.g., adding acoustic considerations to an aero/structural problem) or adding depth (e.g., quantifying the sensitivity of the results to various parameters, exploring multi-objective trade-offs, performing optimization under uncertainty, etc.)</p>

<!-- For example, a successful two person project worked on wind farm optimization where one person focused on aerodynamics and another on acoustics.  This project would have been less successful as a 3-person team where 2 focused on aerodynamics and one on acoustics.  If adding a third person, the scope should be increased and add another area of contribution (e.g., structural analysis, financial modeling, uncertainty quantification, etc.).   -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-4">Open Science</h2>

<p>The final deliverable should be made publicly available unless extenuating circumstances apply (like working with proprietary data, in which case you need to obtain prior approval with me). Why? You tend to product higher quality work with a public audience, and you will be able to make a more significant impact for good.</p>

<p>Some of you may want to submit your work to a conference or journal down the road, and may be concerned about prior publication or getting scooped.  Almost all publishers do not consider the posting of preprints or research outputs online as prior publication.  However, if you have any concerns, one of the archives we use provides an embargo option.  This allows you to submit your work, but select a user-defined future time on when the content should publicly appear.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-5">Milestone Details</h2>

<p>All submissions should be done via Learning Suite and are due by midnight.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Abstract</strong>
</p>

<p>Submit a one-page PDF containing your project title, the names of your team members, a 300-500 word description of your proposed project, and references from 3 relevant journal papers.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Draft Report</strong>
</p>

<p>Your draft report should contain an abstract, an introduction, a description of your methodology, preliminary results, preliminary conclusions, and references.  This milestone is designed to make sure you are on track, provide you with some feedback, and make it easier to complete a high-quality final report.  Your draft report should be in PDF format and be no more than 5 pages (not including references).</p>

<!-- An detailed outline will help you develop clear logical flow and make it easier to complete the final report.   -->
<!-- An extended outline is much more than a list of section headers.  Imaging distilling each paragraph in a report into a topic sentence&mdash;that would be a good extended outline.  Bullet format in some places if fine, but for areas related to optimization methodology and preliminary results you should expand as much as possible so that you can receive better feedback.  You should have preliminary results by this point, and at least a couple figures. -->

<!-- , and contain a draft introduction, methodology, some preliminary results, and some preliminary conclusions.  This milestone is designed to make sure you are on track and to provide you with feedback.
 -->
<p>
   <strong>Presentation</strong>
</p>

<p>You will sign up for a 10 minute presentation time slot.  The presentation is graded only for completion.  Group projects will have 8 minutes to present and 2 minutes for Q&amp;A.  Individuals will have 6 minutes to present and 2 minutes for Q&amp;A.  Obviously you will not have a lot of time to spend on details.  Instead, you should focus on motivation (what the problem is and why it is important), the solution approach, and the most important results.  Each member of the team should have a role in the presentation.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Final Report</strong>
</p>

<p>Your report must be in PDF format, be no more than 10 pages (not including references), and contain the typical elements of a journal paper including an abstract, introduction (including a discussion of prior work), methodology (in sufficient detail that a practitioner could reproduce your results), results (including a detailed discussion on their meaning and relevance), conclusion, and references.  If you have lots of symbols you might consider providing a nomenclature section. Format your paper in the journal style of your field.  If you don’t have a particular field, you can use the <a href="http://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=4597">AIAA style</a>.  Most journals (including AIAA) provide LaTeX style files and/or MS Word templates.</p>

<p>The quality and clarity of your writing is important.  Your career will likely involve lots of writing.  I encourage you to solicit feedback early and often.  The <a href="http://writingcenter.byu.edu">BYU Writing Center</a> is one excellent resource available to you.</p>

<p>When complete, submit your report to a public archive.  Some good options include <a href="https://figshare.com">figshare</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org">zenodo</a>.  If you want to set an embargo then use figshare (be sure to embargo the file(s) onlym and not the whole item).  Confer with your advisor/co-authors and select whatever period of embargo time you are comfortable with.  Where possible I encourage you to also post code/data for a more significant impact.</p>

<!-- (this is purely for public good, I won't grade you on whether or not you elect to do so).   -->

<p>Submit the following via Learning Suite:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A link to your archived report in the format below.  This is a markdown link, so please follow this format exactly including use of brackets and spacing.  Also be sure to provide the DOI style link.<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">- [Title of Article in Title Case](https://dx.doi.org/... this is the url to your report) by Author One, Author Two, and Author Three.</code></li>
  <li>The PDF (only necessary if there is an embargo or you received approval for private submission).</li>
  <li>An approximate percentage breakdown in effort for yourself and the rest of your team members (total must add up to 100%).
<!-- 4. A description of any work included in your report that was done previous to this semester, or that contains contributions from people outside your project team. --></li>
</ol>

<p>Some of you will have final reports that will be nearly publication ready.  If appropriate, I encourage you to consider spending the effort after the class is over to prepare your work for submission to a conference or journal.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-6">Grading</h2>

<p>The final report will be graded using the same criteria that I would use in evaluating a prospective journal article.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Is this a relevant problem of importance in your field of interest?  Is there sufficient literature review to support the relevance of the problem and put it in context?</li>
  <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Is the work novel and a potentially useful contribution to the field?  Is this impact clearly demonstrated (e.g., showing improvements to an existing or baseline design/process, demonstration with actual data, etc.)?  Is the work reproducible?  Is there sufficient detail that another researcher could read your paper and reproduce your results? (Posting code along with your PDF makes this pretty much automatic, but a solid description of methodology with equations and parameter values can also work.)</li>
  <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Is the work of good quality and technically accurate?  Do the optimization approaches conform to best practices?  Is an optimal solution just presented, or is its meaning and implications also discussed and explored?  Is the problem well-scoped for the team size?</li>
  <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Is the writing clear and logical?  Are figures and tables well-presented?</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be asked to rate your contribution and that of your peers (as a percentage).  You will be penalized if you contribute less than expected.  I do not expect a perfect balance, but do expect a balance within +/-5% (e.g., 45/55 for a 2-person team would be considered balanced).  For most teams this is not an issue.</p>

<p>To compute your project score I will first compute a separate team score.  Then I will average the contribution estimates from all team members and then give you the benefit of the doubt with an added 5% uncertainty margin.  Your score will be computed using this formula:
<img src="../score.svg" alt="score" /></p>

<p>For example, suppose you were on a 3-person team and your team score was 98%.  If you contributed at least 28.3% or greater than your individual score would also be 98%.  But if you contributed less (e.g., say 25%) then your score would be
98% (25+5)/(33.3) = 88%</p>

<!-- \begin{equation*}
    98% \left(\frac{25+5}{33.3}\right) = 88%
\end{equation*}
 -->
<!-- \begin{equation*}
    \text{individual score} = \text{team score} \times \min\left(\frac{\text{contribution + 5\%}}{\text{expected contribution}}, 1\right)
\end{equation*} -->

<!-- Each team members needs to fill out and submit the ``Final Project Supplemental Form'' that is posted on Learning Suite.  This form allows you to detail your role and contributions from others.  You will not receive a grade for your final project until your supplemental form is submitted. -->
