<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Overview</h2>

<p>Aerodynamics is the application of fluid dynamic principles to the motion of air (or a gas in general) around solid bodies (e.g., airplanes, rockets, trains, cars, etc.).  Our primary focus is to learn how to predict aerodynamic forces and moments, like lift and drag, across various flow conditions.  We explore 2D airfoils, 3D wings, and rotating blades across a range of Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers.  Of particularly emphasis is the use of numerical methods that are widely used in modern aerodynamic analysis.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Prerequisites: ME EN 273, ME EN 312</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p><strong>Flow Similarity</strong>:
Effectively use non-dimensional force coefficients and parameters in aerodynamic modeling and prediction.</p>

<p><strong>Incompressible Aerodynamics</strong>:
Apply potential flow theory and thin-airfoil theory to estimate forces and moments of an airfoil.</p>

<p><strong>Finite Wings</strong>:
Compute lift-dependent drag and span efficiency of finite wings, and demonstrate an understanding of the relationships between wing design and its aerodynamic performance.</p>

<p><strong>Viscous Aerodynamics</strong>:
Apply integral momentum boundary layer equations and empirical methods for laminar and turbulent boundary layers to estimate transition, separation, drag, and stall.</p>

<p><strong>Compressible Aerodynamics</strong>:
Demonstrate an understanding of the physical processes causing wave drag and be able to estimate wave drag.</p>

<p><strong>Propellers</strong>:
Predict thrust, power required, and efficiency and demonstrate an understanding of the relationships between propeller design and its aerodynamic performance.</p>

<p><strong>Computational Fluid Dynamics</strong>:
Use CFD software to simulate basic aerodynamic applications.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-4">Course Work</h2>

<p>Graduate courses are more time intensive than undergraduate courses.  The typical expectation is four hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared.  That means that the average student will need to be put in at least 9.5 hours of work outside of the classroom each week.</p>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>Good: attend class regularly and punctually.<br />
Better: attend and be attentive in class.<br />
Best: attend, be attentive, and <strong>actively participate</strong> in the classroom discussion.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask what you think might be a simple question, usually someone else is wondering the same thing and you are doing them a favor by asking.  Be respectful of your peers and arrive to class on time (but if you are late please don’t feel like you can’t come in).</p>

<p>Class time should not be a passive experience.  In addition to asking questions, you should come prepared to work on problems in class. I will often ask you to work individually or with small groups on example problems and design exercises in class.  I encourage you to bring a laptop, if possible, to work on in-class exercises.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>Most of the reading will come from <em>Fundamentals of Aerodynamics</em> by John Anderson (4th, 5th, or 6th Ed.). No homework problems will come from the text, just background reading.  The differences in these versions are minor and inconsequential for our purposes and having more options should allow you to save some money. The textbook is written in a clear and conversational style, and I think you will find reading it much more approachable than most textbooks.  A careful reading of the text is essential for this class.  The schedule lists only the most important readings, but if you are serious about the subject of aerodynamics you really should read the complete text.  Keep in mind that this textbook is only introductory in nature, and will be supplemented with more depth through the slides, and additional readings.</p>

<p>Most class periods will have an assigned reading, and I expect you to complete the readings beforehand.  I cannot, not would it be effective to, cover all the content you need to know in class.  Instead, class time will be used for discussing difficult concepts, diving deeper into or expanding on concepts you were exposed to in your reading, answering questions, working examples together, and testing understanding.</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>The homework in this class will be different than most undergraduate courses.  Homework will be due every other week, each with a 2-week scope.  You should think of them as mini-projects.  Homework will typically be due on Wednesdays at midnight (actually 11:59pm) and will be turned in via Learning Suite.  Last minute issues often happen in life so be sure to start your work early and submit early!  Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 20% per day.  Extensions will not be granted (excepting extreme events like a hospitalization or death in the family).</p>

<p>Assignments are expected to be produced in a report or memo format.  A series of equations and “solutions” is insufficient.  Each report should introduce the problem and any assumptions, detail the methodology, and discuss the results and conclusions.  Please see the BYU Mechanical Engineering Department <a href="https://me.byu.edu/students/resources">Problem Solving Resources</a>.  Specifically, look at <a href="https://me.byu.edu/sites/default/files/Communicating%20Solutions%20Sheet%201.1.pdf">Communicating Engineering Solutions</a>.  If unfamiliar with IMRaD, information on this writing genre is provided at the same link.  Why a report format?  You will learn deeper by having to explain in words, improve your writing skills, practice for future reports in your engineering career, and be able to access and understand your work better when referring to it later.</p>

<!-- Homework will be *partially* self-graded.  Reviewing your own work with a guided solution will help you better understand concepts you may have missed, and will allow you to see alternative solution approaches.  Other parts require external feedback and the teaching staff will grade those. -->

<p>Working with others on homework is certainly encouraged, but you must prepare your own reports.  <strong>Referring to solution manuals or prior student’s homework  is a violation of the honor code.</strong></p>

<h3 id="quizzes-and-exams">Quizzes and Exams</h3>

<p>There will be weekly low-stakes quizzes to engage your thinking on important concepts, assess your understanding, and practice for the exams.  Typically quizzes will open after class on Friday (covering the topics and readings from that past week) and will be due by the end of the following Monday.  Sometimes you will be absent or behind on your readings so your lowest two quiz scores will be dropped.</p>

<p>There will be one midterm exam and one comprehensive final exam.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>An approximate percent breakdown is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homework: 50%</li>
  <li>Quizzes and Exams: 50%</li>
</ul>

<!-- 
75 x 6 = 450
10*10 = 100
150 midterm
200 final 
-->

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>

<p>In addition to holding office hours, we use <a href="https://piazza.com/byu/winter2018/meen515">Piazza</a> to assist you in asking for and giving help.  Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza.  After signing up for an account, you may wish to visit your notification preferences (I prefer batch notifications).  <strong>We also use Piazza for all class announcements, so make sure to sign up!</strong></p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-5">Influential Engineers</h2>

<p>One of the fundamental objectives of the department is to help you become influential engineers.  We have drafted the following summary of what it means to be an influential engineer that you should become familiar with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Influential engineers impact the world in a variety of ways. While some may affect large numbers of people in obvious, publicly recognized ways, others will quietly lead and inspire those within their sphere of influence in less recognized ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To maximize their potential to be influential engineers, students must come to recognize their strengths and apply them in ways that lead to a positive impact on people, problems, and the profession. Since each student is unique, defining influence is highly personal and will typically change over time as new opportunities arise and new skills are developed. Regardless of where students find themselves having the most impact, they will become influential engineers as they develop technical excellence, leadership, communication skills, character, and a commitment to lifelong learning and service.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Influential Engineers Develop…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Excellence</strong>: Influential engineers are innovative experts in their field. They have earned trust from others by successfully apply engineering concepts, principles and practices to solve real world problems..</li>
    <li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Regardless of their positions, influential engineers lead in thought and behavior. They are more focused on the greater good than on personal achievement. They are able to make tough decisions, when necessary. They inspire and help others to reach their potential.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication Skills</strong>: Influential engineers effectively communicate results and conclusions clearly and concisely. They communicate persuasively to present recommendations and prevent and solve problems. They work well with others.</li>
    <li><strong>Character</strong>: Influential engineers are individuals of high integrity. Their character and competence are respected by colleagues.  An influential engineer’s sphere of influence is expanded as people come to recognize and trust their character.</li>
    <li><strong>Lifelong Learning and Service</strong>: Influential engineers want to do good in the world and use their abilities to enhance the lives of others and the profession. They consistently seek to expand their ability to help more people or help them more effectively.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-6">University Policies</h2>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university’s expectation, and every instructor’s expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

<h3 id="preventing--responding-to-sexual-misconduct">Preventing &amp; Responding to Sexual Misconduct</h3>

<p>In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Brigham Young University prohibits unlawful sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. The university also prohibits sexual harassment—including sexual violence—committed by or against students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of “Sexual Misconduct” prohibited by the university.</p>

<p>University policy requires all university employees in a teaching, managerial, or supervisory role to report all incidents of Sexual Misconduct that come to their attention in any way, including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post.  Incidents of Sexual Misconduct should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or (801) 422-8692.  Reports may also be submitted through EthicsPoint at https://titleix.byu.edu/report or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours a day).</p>

<p>BYU offers confidential resources for those affected by Sexual Misconduct, including the university’s Victim Advocate, as well as a number of non-confidential resources and services that may be helpful. Additional information about Title IX, the university’s Sexual Misconduct Policy, reporting requirements, and resources can be found at http://titleix.byu.edu or by contacting the university’s Title IX Coordinator.</p>

<h3 id="student-disability">Student Disability</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 422-2767. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895, D-285 ASB.</p>

<h3 id="inappropriate-use-of-course-materials">Inappropriate Use Of Course Materials</h3>

<p>All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code.</p>

<h3 id="respectful-environment">Respectful Environment</h3>

<p>“Sadly, from time to time, we do hear reports of those who are at best insensitive and at worst insulting in their comments to and about others… We hear derogatory and sometimes even defamatory comments about those with different political, athletic, or ethnic views or experiences. Such behavior is completely out of place at BYU, and I enlist the aid of all to monitor carefully and, if necessary, correct any such that might occur here, however inadvertent or unintentional. “I worry particularly about demeaning comments made about the career or major choices of women or men either directly or about members of the BYU community generally. We must remember that personal agency is a fundamental principle and that none of us has the right or option to criticize the lawful choices of another.” President Cecil O. Samuelson, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010 “Occasionally, we … hear reports that our female faculty feel disrespected, especially by students, for choosing to work at BYU, even though each one has been approved by the BYU Board of Trustees. Brothers and sisters, these things ought not to be. Not here. Not at a university that shares a constitution with the School of the Prophets.” Vice President John S. Tanner, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010</p>

<h3 id="devotional-attendance">Devotional Attendance</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University’s devotional and forum assemblies are an important part of your BYU experience. President Cecil O. Samuelson said, “We have special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies…that will complement, supplement, and enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday…and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you…A large part of what constitutes the unique ‘BYU experience’ is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus” (from the address “The Legacy of Learning”, 30 August, 2005). Your attendance at each forum and devotional is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h3>

<p>Mental health concerns and stressful life events can affect students’ academic performance and quality of life. BYU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS, 1500 WSC, 801-422-3035, caps.byu.edu) provides individual, couples, and group counseling, as well as stress management services. These services are confidential and are provided by the university at no cost for full-time students. For general information please visit https://caps.byu.edu; for more immediate concerns please visit http://help.byu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to “be honest.” Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life’s work, but also to build character. “President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education” (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another’s words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgement, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author’s own. Plagiarism Mosaic-The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one’s own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student’s work and submitting it as one’s own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.</p>
