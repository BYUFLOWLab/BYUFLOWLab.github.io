<h3 id="wind-farm-optimization-under-uncertainty">Wind Farm Optimization Under Uncertainty</h3>

<p>Effective wind farm optimization involves a large number of design variables and contains many sources of uncertainty (e.g., wind direction, wind speed, turbulence levels, wake model parameters, etc.).  We are developing scalable methods for large-scale optimization, uncertainty quantification, and optimization under uncertainty and applying these methods to advance energy sustainability through improved wind farm performance. </p>

<h3 id="vawt-wake-model-development">VAWT Wake Model Development</h3>

<p><img src="vawt_wake.jpg" class="research-image img-left"></p>

<p>Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are a promising technology for offshore applications and in the built environment.  Performance of wind farms is highly dependent on effective integration, and this research is focused on developing engineering wake models for VAWTs to enable farm optimization.</p>

<!-- because their lower center of gravity reduces foundation costs and their simplified mechanical components reduce maintenance costs -->

<!-- VAWT wind farms will face similar challenges, but VAWTs have very different wake behavior that must be understood to effectively design their layout. The evolution of wakes behind wind turbines is a complex turbulent process that can be visualized with high-fidelity instrumentation or high-fidelity simulation. However, for performing layout optimization, which must broadly explore many configurations, simpler engineering wake models are needed. This research effort is focused on developing VAWT engineering wake models to enable effective VAWT wind farm layout optimization. -->

<h3 id="integrated-wind-farm-layout-optimization">Integrated Wind Farm Layout Optimization</h3>

<p><img src="windRose.png" class="research-image img-right"></p>

<p>Efficient layout design is a significant challenge, and todayâ€™s wind farms underperform energy capture expectations by around 10-20%.  We seek to efficiently combine turbine, layout, and controls optimization in an integrated manner.  Recent work has compared the <a href="../publications/#Thomas2015">impact of two different wake models on optimization</a> and conducted initial studies in combined <a href="../publications/#Fleming2015">layout-yaw optimization</a></p>

<!-- Wind plant controls seek to improve global wind plant performance over control systems in which each turbine optimizes only its individual performance by accounting for the way wind turbines interact through their wakes.   -->

<p>By free-form design we mean simultaneous airfoil and blade design as opposed to the traditional sequential approach.  We are exploring free-form design through a range of fidelities.  <a href="../publications/Barrett2015">Initial studies</a> have been helpful in quantifying expected benefits.</p>

<p><img src="windfarm_illustration.jpg" class="research-image img-left">
Efficient extraction of wind energy is a complex, multidisciplinary process.  We have developed a number of open-source integrated wind turbine analysis tools as part of the <a href="https://nwtc.nrel.gov/WISDEM">WISDEM</a> toolset.  Many of these tools provide exact gradients through automatic differentiation and/or adjoint methods.  During the development a new methodology for solving the blade element momentum equations was developed with <a href="../publications/#Ning2014">guaranteed convergence</a>---useful for use with gradient-based optimization. These models have been in studies to understand the <a href="../publications/#Ning2014c">impact of using different objectives</a> in wind turbine optimization, analyze the impact of <a href="../publications/#Ning2014d">high-tip speed rotors</a>, compare optimized <a href="../publications/#Ning2014a">downwind and upwind turbines</a>, and study the benefits of <a href="../publications/#Gray2014">mixed-derivatives in wind turbine optimization</a>.</p>

<h3 id="formation-flight-(ph.d.-at-stanford)">Formation Flight (Ph.D. at Stanford)</h3>

<p><img src="formflight_big.png" class="research-image img-right">  We explore a safer approach to formation flying of transport aircraft, which we term <em>extended formation flight</em>. Extended formations take advantage of the persistence of cruise wakes and extends the streamwise separation between the aircraft by at least five wingspans. At large distances, considerations such as wake rollup, atmospheric effects on circulation decay, and vortex motion become important to consider. We examine the wake rollup process in the context of extended formations and develop appropriate physics-based models. Our research address multiple aspects of formation flight: <a href="../publications/#Ning2011">longitudinally extended formations</a>, <a href="../publications/#Ning2014b">compressibility effects</a>, formations of <a href="../publications/#Ning2011b">heterogeneous aircraft</a>, and <a href="../publications/#Xu2014a">formation route optimization</a>.</p>
