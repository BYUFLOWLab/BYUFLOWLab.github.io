      <p>This page overviews some of the logistical activities you will need to go through as a graduate student.  I do not provide details on the logistics, those you can find in the graduate handbook, rather I am imparting some advice I frequently repeat to new graduate students.  These are my own views, not all faculty members will view the purposes of these milestones the same way.</p>

<h2 id="course-selection">Course Selection</h2>

<p>My main advice is to choose courses you are interested in.  You will learn more and have a more satisfying experiencing if you follow your interests.  You may even find some ideas in an unrelated field that help you with your research.  Of course, you will also need to take classes that are directly related to your research, but presumably you are interested in those anyway (otherwise you picked the wrong research topic).  See <a href="../reading/#tocAnchor-1-1-3">Learning &gt; BYU Courses</a> for some suggestions.</p>

<p>Don’t take more than 2 classes per semester.  There just isn’t time for that.  Take your classes seriously, but remember that research is always a higher priority over classes.  It can be too easy to linger in the relative safety of classes where there are often known answers and more immediate feedback from homework scores, but you have to prioritize the more important but much harder open-ended questions with no known solution and delayed feedback from research.  This can be a hard  transition for undergraduate students.</p>

<p>If you are a PhD student you will almost certainly find a few interesting and useful classes that won’t count towards your degree (e.g., a 400-level CS class, a business class).  Take them anyway!  (within reason).  Although if they aren’t relevant to your research, you should save them until after you complete your program of study.  If you are a MS student, unfortunately there just isn’t time, but fortunately one or two 400-level technical classes can count for you.</p>

<p>I’d also recommend taking advantage of the unique opportunity you have to take fun 0.5 credit classes like tennis, bowling, martial arts, etc.  Good for the body and mind.  (again, within reason)</p>

<p>A typical course registration looks like the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fall: 6 credits courses, 1 credit research</li>
  <li>Winter: 6 credits courses, 1 credit research</li>
  <li>Spring: 1 credit research</li>
  <li>Summer: 1 credit research</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking 1 credit every semester/term should put you on track to complete the necessary thesis/dissertation credits.  Some adaptation will be necessary if gone for a summer internship or if you are an international student (don’t register during spring/summer)</p>

<h2 id="committee">Committee</h2>

<p>Your research will have some aspects that are outside your advisor’s areas of expertise.  The purpose of a committee is to provide additional expertise in those areas and to provide broader feedback and direction within the same field.  Select other faculty that would be helpful to you.  You don’t need to meet with them regularly to report or anything like that.  They are a resource to help you, so meet with them when they can help you with something.  It’s ok if you don’t know them.  As long as your topic crosses their expertise in some way, they will be happy to help.  All of us serve on a wide variety of thesis/dissertation committees, in most cases with students that we did not know previously.</p>

<h2 id="prospectus">Prospectus</h2>

<p>See the guidelines under <a href="../writing/#tocAnchor-1-1-7">Writing &gt; Proposals</a>.  Be sure to explicitly answer all of those questions. Writing a prospectus is very different than writing a scientific paper.  You need a solid plan, but like all research projects you should expect that there will be deviations.  The purpose is to help you plan ahead and think about the bigger picture.  Rather than think of this as a one-time document, you should think of it as one step in what should be periodic reflection and replanning to align with what is most impactful and essential.</p>

<h2 id="qualifying-exams-phd">Qualifying Exams (PhD)</h2>

<p>If you take your preparation seriously, this can be one of the more transformative parts of your education.  A PhD student needs to demonstrate impactful and original research (primarily demonstrated through your dissertation), and needs to demonstrate a broad understand of fundamentals (primarily demonstrated through qualifying exams).  In other words, this is a major milestone.  The goal is not to pass the exams.  The goal is to develop a solid understanding of fundamentals.  You should be so well prepared that the exams are a mere formality.  If you are diligent in your preparation you will lay a  foundation of knowledge that you will build on throughout your career.  You will strengthen your ability to learn new things independently—an essential skill in an every changing world.  You will also find great satisfaction in your deepened level of understanding and greater confidence to move forward into new areas of learning.  There will likely never be another opportunity in your life to dedicate your time and focus so completely to subject mastery in this way, so although it is hard be sure to cherish it!</p>

<p>You need to start your preparation at least one semester prior to taking the exams. Start slow and ramp up.  I strongly recommend studying with a group.  It can be helpful to take turns working problems out on the board in front of the group.  A group provides feedback (essential so that you don’t unknowingly learn something incorrectly!), encouragement, and can help you gather a broader set of problems to test your understanding.   During the semester of quals, I recommend taking a lighter course load.  Maybe just one class, unless the two classes are both helpful in your quals preparation.</p>
