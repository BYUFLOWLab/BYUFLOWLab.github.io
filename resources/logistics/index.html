      <p>This page overviews some of the logistical activities you will need to go through as a graduate student.  I do not provide details on the logistics, those you can find in the graduate handbook, rather I am imparting some advice I frequently repeat to new graduate students.  These are my own views, not all faculty members will view the purposes of these milestones the same way.</p>

<h2 id="course-selection">Course Selection</h2>

<p>My main advice is to choose courses you are interested in.  You will learn more and have a more satisfying experiencing if you follow your interests.  You may even find some ideas in an unrelated field that help you with your research.  Of course, you will also need to take classes that are directly related to your research, but presumably you are interested in those anyway (otherwise you picked the wrong research topic).  See <a href="../reading/#tocAnchor-1-1-3">Learning &gt; BYU Courses</a> for some suggestions.</p>

<p>Don’t take more than 2 classes per semester.  There just isn’t time for that.  Take your classes seriously, but remember that research is always a higher priority over classes.  It can be too easy to linger in the relative safety of classes where there are often known answers and more immediate feedback from homework scores, but you have to prioritize the more important but much harder open-ended questions with no known solution and delayed feedback from research.  This can be a hard  transition for undergraduate students.</p>

<p>If you are a PhD student you will almost certainly find a few interesting and useful classes that won’t count towards your degree (e.g., a 400-level CS class, a business class).  Take them anyway!  (within reason).  Although if they aren’t relevant to your research, you should save them until after you complete your program of study.  If you are a MS student, unfortunately there just isn’t time, but fortunately one or two 400-level technical classes can count for you.</p>

<p>I’d also recommend taking advantage of the unique opportunity you have to take fun 0.5 credit classes like tennis, bowling, martial arts, etc.  Good for the body and mind.  (again, within reason)</p>

<p>A typical course registration looks like the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fall: 6 credits courses, 1 credit research</li>
  <li>Winter: 6 credits courses, 1 credit research</li>
  <li>Spring: 1 credit research</li>
  <li>Summer: 1 credit research</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking 1 credit every semester/term should put you on track to complete the necessary thesis/dissertation credits.  Some adaptation will be necessary if gone for a summer internship or if you are an international student (don’t register during spring/summer)</p>

<h2 id="committee">Committee</h2>

<p>Your research will have some aspects that are outside your advisor’s areas of expertise.  The purpose of a committee is to provide additional expertise in those areas and to provide broader feedback and direction within the same field.  Select other faculty that would be helpful to you.  You don’t need to meet with them regularly to report or anything like that.  They are a resource to help you, so meet with them when they can help you with something.  It’s ok if you don’t know them.  As long as your topic crosses their expertise in some way, they will be happy to help.  All of us serve on a wide variety of thesis/dissertation committees, in most cases with students that we did not know previously.</p>

<h2 id="prospectus">Prospectus</h2>

<p>You will need to write a prospectus during your graduate work, which is essentially a short proposal.  Writing a proposal is different than writing a scientific paper.  A proposal is intended to be a persuasive argument (rather than a presentation of results and an illumination of their implications).  You need to persuade the reader that the problems you are trying to solve are important, that you’ve carefully thought through how you will accomplish the work, and that you have the resources and training you need to succeed.  You must have a solid plan, but don’t worry that it must be cast in stone.  Like all research projects you should expect that there will be deviations.  The purpose is to help you plan ahead and think about the bigger picture.  Rather than think of this as a one-time document, you should think of it as one step in what should be periodic reflection and replanning to align with what is most impactful and essential.</p>

<p>Make sure you <em>explicitly</em> answer the following questions in any proposal, as these are the criteria an evaluator will use to judge its merit.  <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism">These questions</a> come from George H. Heilmeier, a former DARPA director:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</li>
  <li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</li>
  <li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?</li>
  <li>Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?</li>
  <li>What are the risks?</li>
  <li>How much will it cost?  (this is less relevant for a prospectus)</li>
  <li>How long will it take?</li>
  <li>What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?</li>
</ul>

<!-- 1. Is the problem important?  (clearly define what the problem is and convince the reader that it is important)
2. Is the proposed solution innovative and impactful? (clearly describe the outcomes and how they will be impactful)
3. Is this person/team uniquely qualified to perform this work and is it likely to lead to a successful outcome? (you need a well-defined *specific* work plan, a reasonable scope, and ideally some preliminary results that lend confidence that this is feasible) -->

<p>Other advice related to addressing these questions in your prospectus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read this excellent <a href="http://rapids.ucsd.edu/documents/PorterSalesPitch2011.pdf">summary</a> on how to put together a strong introduction.</li>
  <li>Usually the weakest part I see is the work plan, and that should be the primary focus of the prospectus.  A vague work plan won’t help you at all.  If you take this process seriously you will save yourself a lot of time and headache later.  I’ve gone through the process of writing a proposal on an idea I thought was promising, but after carefully writing it out I realized it wasn’t worth pursuing and needed to change direction.  Better to figure that out now instead of later!  A good work plan will provide a blueprint for your research.  Blueprints can change of course, but no one would start building a house with only a vague plan in mind.</li>
  <li>Create a timeline with milestones.  Plan out how long each step will reasonably take, and make sure you have an appropriate scope.</li>
  <li>How will you know you succeeded?  What are the metrics?  If you don’t know what success looks like, it will be hard to get there.</li>
  <li>Think about contingencies (especially for a PhD).  Your first and second paper should have a pretty solid plan, but papers 3 and 4 may be dependent on what happens in the first two stages.  Have a backup plan in case your results in those early stages don’t follow what you hypothesized.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Another great resource are these two short documents from George Hazelrigg, a longtime program director at the National Science Foundation.  Not everything in that paper applies to you, but there are still several important points for your work: [one](https://poole.ncsu.edu/i/com/weblogs/research-development/Honing-Proposal-Skillls-1.pdf), [two](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~trink/HazelriggWinningResearchProposal.pdf) -->

<h2 id="qualifying-exams-phd">Qualifying Exams (PhD)</h2>

<p>If you take your preparation seriously, this can be one of the more transformative parts of your education.  A PhD student needs to demonstrate impactful and original research (primarily demonstrated through your dissertation), and needs to demonstrate a broad understand of fundamentals (primarily demonstrated through qualifying exams).  In other words, this is a major milestone.  The goal is not to pass the exams.  The goal is to develop a solid understanding of fundamentals.  You should be so well prepared that the exams are a mere formality.  If you are diligent in your preparation you will lay a  foundation of knowledge that you will build on throughout your career.  You will strengthen your ability to learn new things independently—an essential skill in an every changing world.  You will also find great satisfaction in your deepened level of understanding and greater confidence to move forward into new areas of learning.  There will likely never be another opportunity in your life to dedicate your time and focus so completely to subject mastery in this way, so although it is hard be sure to cherish it!</p>

<p>You need to start your preparation at least one semester prior to taking the exams. Start slow and ramp up.  I strongly recommend studying with a group.  It can be helpful to take turns working problems out on the board in front of the group.  A group provides feedback (essential so that you don’t unknowingly learn something incorrectly!), encouragement, and can help you gather a broader set of problems to test your understanding.   During the semester of quals, I recommend taking a lighter course load.  Maybe just one class, unless the two classes are both helpful in your quals preparation.</p>
