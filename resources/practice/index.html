</div><h1 id="tocAnchor-1-1">Continual Skill Development (Deliberate Practice)</h1>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Overview</h2>

<p>During the lead up to conference/journal submission students develop rapidly as we cycle through many iterations of results/writing/presentation with lots of feedback.  In between these stages, development often slows.  By applying concepts of deliberate practice on a more consistent basis your performance and skill development will accelerate.</p>

<p>One key is an intensity of focus on areas that need improvement.  It’s the difference between just going out and playing tennis versus filming your backhand, breaking it down, making corrections, and performing many repetitions to perfect your backhand.  The former allows for initial growth followed by stagnation once you get to a passable level.  The latter allows for continued accelerated growth and improvement.  The former is appropriate for a hobbyist while the later leads to a professional.</p>

<p>A second key is expert feedback. Activities like sports provide a fair amount of built-in immediate feedback (e.g., you can see if the ball went in the hoop or not).  For many other activities though, like research, you will need to seek out frequent external feedback.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">Skills/Traits</h2>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of ten skills/traits you will grow in as a graduate researcher (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Code Development</strong>: The ability to effectively translate engineering concepts into useful analysis tools that are both correct and clear.  The ability to produce code that is well documented, and well tested with corresponding unit tests.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientific Process</strong>: The ability to develop a logical work plan (whether computational or experimental), carry out the plan in a rigorous manner, and meaningfully process and assess data.  As you progress, particularly as a PhD student, greater independence in this process is also expected.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientific Writing</strong>: The ability to motivate research, explain and present results clearly through words and figures, and develop clear organizational structure.  A second genre of writing includes persuasive writing (e.g., prospectus, proposals), which requires the ability to articulate the importance of a problem, clearly describe a path forward, and define the expected impact.</li>
  <li><strong>Presenting</strong>: The ability to effectively communicate and produce clear and engaging visual aids.</li>
  <li><strong>Creativity</strong>: The ability to generate and evaluate ideas, find solutions to problems, propose research directions, and look at problems in different ways.</li>
  <li><strong>Impact</strong>: A mindset focused on solving meaningful technical and societal challenges, with the courage to take risks as necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>Subject Mastery</strong>: The drive and discipline to master relevant engineering topics through independent study and coursework pursuant to becoming an influential engineer.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentoring</strong>: The ability to lead, help, and teach others effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication</strong>: The habit and skill of active listening and providing consistent and clear communication to the advisor, collaborators, sponsor, and society.</li>
  <li><strong>Time and Project Management</strong>: The ability to effectively plan, reevaluate and make adjustments, and eliminate distractions and other roadblocks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">Deliverables and Feedback</h2>

<p>Ultimately you are responsible for your own development, but I’ve instituted a few activities to assist you.  I’ve found that externally-imposed deadlines help encourage a greater intensity of focus and provide a natural avenue for feedback (although you should continue to develop the ability to set your own deadlines that you strictly adhere to—a very difficult skill to develop!).</p>

<h4 id="end-of-semester-report">End of Semester Report</h4>

<p>Each semester (Sp/Su is one semester) you will be required to submit a final report.  Typically, it should be your current closest approximation to the journal paper you are working on.  Submit it as if you were submitting to the journal.  I will review it and provide feedback and an assessment.  A prospectus, section of your thesis/dissertation, or research proposal for your next study is also appropriate. The hope is that through regular feedback (and regular careful transfer of ideas/results to paper) your progression will accelerate.  If you submitted an actual conference paper, journal paper, or prospectus that semester then you have fulfilled this requirement.  If you’re just starting then it’s likely that your paper will be mostly a literature review and methodology (and maybe some very preliminary results)—just like an AIAA extended abstract.  There is no need to start from a blank slate each semester.  Each submission should be an improvement of your current paper until you submit the actual journal paper.</p>

<p>In addition to a report, most of you should also submit code via a GitHub link (code means more than just source code, but also the documentation, tests, structure, commit history, etc.).  We release many codes as open source, and even those stay internal have current/future lab members as potential users.  Taking the time to package code in a well-thought-out manner makes a huge difference (even if the only user is a future you).  Students rarely receive direct feedback on their code development and thus their development in this area is relatively slow.  Like your report, I will review your code submission and provide feedback.  Note: I said <em>most</em> of you because some semesters you may be working on experimental data collection or using commercial tools and thus won’t have a code submission.</p>

<p>Below I list some questions I will use to assess your submissions, and which you may want to ask yourself during development.</p>

<p>Report: Is the problem you are trying to solve clearly motivated?  Is it an impactful and important problem?  Does the literature review demonstrate a strong understanding of the field and is your work placed in context?  Do the figures stand alone in clearly presenting a message and are they visually appealing?  Is the organizational structure clear?  Are there spelling/grammatical errors?  Do the primary messages shine through?  Are results sufficiently explained and expounded on?  Is there sufficient V&amp;V to lend confidence in the correctness of the results?  Are the conclusions supported by the data?  Is there a clear explanation of what the results mean in a broader context, what the limitations of the work area, and where future work may best be focused?</p>

<p>Code:  Is the code correct?  How do I know it is correct (i.e., are there good tests)?  Does it conform to good style?  Does the chosen interface make sense?  Is the implementation efficient?  Are there better algorithms that should be used?  Is it clear and do I know how to use it?  Is it documented sufficiently that I could modify it if needed?  Are good version control practices being used?</p>

<h4 id="performance-review">Performance Review</h4>

<p>Each semester/term we will review your submission, and discuss the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What were your goals last semester and how did it go?</li>
  <li>What are your goals for this coming semester?</li>
  <li>What are your longer term goals (1 year time frame)?</li>
  <li>How can I best assist you in achieving these goals?</li>
  <li>How can you best help others in the lab achieve their goals?</li>
  <li>Any suggestions or ideas for the lab as a whole?</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="individual-customization">Individual Customization</h4>

<p>Some of you will be actively working on a skill and require more frequent feedback.  We can create customized plans for your needs (e.g., a smaller, more targeted code submission every other week).  Sometimes I may suggest a custom plan if I see a strong need, but generally any customization will be driven through your own initiative.  Similarly, I won’t formally keep track of when each performance review was conducted, so generally if you want more frequent feedback you will need to request it.</p>

<!-- #### Individual Feedback

To encourage more formal feedback at a deeper level, I ask each student to submit a deliverable on a specified timeline (ranging from once a week to once a semester depending on the needs and experience of the student).  I will review each deliverable and provide specific feedback.  Deliverables should be review-ready (i.e., reasonably polished like a major class assignment or paper submission). The format of the deliverable is up to you.  It could be code, a segment of writing, a presentation, a list of developed research ideas, etc.  The purpose is not for accountability.  In other words, I don't want a status report.  That's not going to help your development (unless the skill we are trying to develop is accountability). Below are some examples of the types of things I would look for in providing feedback.  Keep in mind you are not expected to submit finished modules and complete papers.  Rather, like a tennis backhand, we want to zoom in on small elements (i.e., an introduction, a complete portion of a code module, etc.) where we can iterate through focused and frequent feedback. -->

<!-- #### Group Exercises

Learning from the example of others can be highly effective.  However, in order to compare work with others sometimes the topic won't be directly related to our research. While that may seem like a distraction, I've found that thinking outside of one's domain (in small increments) can be helpful in opening up one's mind to new ideas and better ways of doing things.  We will intentionally limit these types of activities to two hours a month max (one hour prep beforehand as needed, one hour meeting as a group).

Once a month we will have some sort of group skill building activity.  Some potential examples include: a coding challenge that we all implement and then compare results, a writing workshop where we all bring a writing sample and critique each other's work, or a three-minute-thesis-like competition.  These should be fun while allowing for good focus and rapid feedback. -->
