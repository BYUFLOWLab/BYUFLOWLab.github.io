<h2 id="prospective-undergraduate-researchers">Prospective Undergraduate Researchers</h2>

<h3 id="how-to-get-involved">How to get involved</h3>

<p>ME 273 is a prerequisite for all of our projects.  Some projects might require additional prerequisites like ME 312.</p>

<p>There are three ways to get involved: volunteer, ME 497R, or paid position.  We generally discourage the volunteering route as it is difficult to maintain with a busy undergraduate schedule.  497R is usually the ideal route for new researchers.  Registering for ME 497R opens up time in your schedule for research, and the course fulfills a tech elective towards graduation.  Registering for 3 credits requires about 9-10 hours of work per week (2 credits for 6 hours is also possible).  The course is graded, and you will be expected to produce an end-of-semester report.  Those who have completed a 497R in our lab are generally our first picks for paid positions.</p>

<p>Those with more experience (either through other research labs, relevant internships, or coursework) may choose to apply directly to a paid position.  Most paid positions require a minimum one-year commitment (we also commit to you).  Our goal is to help each undergraduate student to contribute to impactful research publications.  It takes a semester or two just to get up to speed, and so short-term research commitments are significantly less effective.  This commitment is another reason why we recommend completing a 497R first.  The 497R project does not require any long-term commitment and gives both you and us a chance to see if a longer term role is a good fit.</p>

<!-- When you first get involved we usually ask you to register for 3 credits of ME 497R.  This allows you to get course credit for your research, and fulfills a technical elective towards your graduation.  By registering for a tech elective it will open up some time in your schedule and help you stay engaged.  3 credits requires about 9-10 hours of work per week (2 credits for 6 hours is also possible).  The course is graded, and you will be expected to produce an end-of-semester report.  Volunteering is also an option, but not one that we encourage.  It is hard to maintain a volunteer-based position with a busy undergraduate schedule.   -->

<!-- Taking ME 497R may be bypassed if you have significant relevant experience either through other research labs, internships/work, or advanced courses like ME 412 or ME 415. -->

  <p><strong>Project Description</strong>:  Our lab is currently developing a reduced-order wake model for vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) that will allow an optimizer to position VAWTs in a wind farm to minimizes wake interference. We have currently developed an initial wake model based on computational fluid dynamic (CFD) data from several VAWT simulations that is capable of predicting with reasonable accuracy the wake behavior of a single VAWT. We are looking to expand this wake model to include multiple wind turbines and their interacting wakes, exploring effects of various blade quantities and shapes, and better understand the three-dimensional nature of VAWT wakes. For this project, we are look for an individual to complete the following tasks:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Learn how to use and becoming familiar with Star-CCM+</li>
    <li>Work with lower fidelity models to gain a basic understanding of wake interaction and guide decisions on where to focus CFD simulations.</li>
    <li>Obtain additional VAWT wake data of single and multiple turbines</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Time Expected</strong>: 5-10 hours</p>

  <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: ME EN 312.  Prior experience with Star-CCM+ preferred. Prior or current enrollment in ME EN 412 preferred.</p>

<div id="eric2" class="bibtex message">

  <p><strong>Project Description</strong>:  Sandia has developed a simulation code called CACTUS (Code for Axial and Cross-flow TUrbine Simulation) which allows a user to model turbines and obtain information about aerodynamic forces and wake velocity deficits in a matter of minutes. This allows for optimization of turbines in a reasonable amount of time due to the speed of the code. Currently, Sandia is in need of wake validation of a 34-meter vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) using the CACTUS code to ensure that the numerical methods match experimental behavior. This project entails:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Obtaining experimental VAWT data from Sandia documentation.</li>
    <li>Running CACTUS with the correct parameters identified to reflect the VAWT geometry and speed.</li>
    <li>Comparing the results of the CACTUS code to the Sandia data and report on the findings between the two.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Time Expected</strong>: 5-10 hours</p>

  <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: ME EN 273. ME EN 312.</p>

  <p><strong>Notes</strong>:
The use of the CACTUS code could be expanded to explore novel configurations, parked and tilted VAWTs, and modify the code to handle multiple turbines.</p>

<!-- Below are some suggestions on how to get involved in our lab, and links to current openings.  

### Prerequisites
- ME 273 is a prerequisite for all of our projects.  
- ME 312 is a prerequisite for many of the projects. -->

<!-- These are just guidelines, and sometimes vary depending on the prior experience level and motivation of the person and the current needs and funding levels of the project.

Prerequisites:

- ME 273 (always)
- ME 312 (usually)

First Steps (~5 hrs/week for one semester):

- Read about ongoing [research projects](../research) and review related [publications](../publications).
- Attend our group meetings to learn more about current projects and meet some of the other students (currently Thursdays at 2PM in 431A CTB).  
- Visit with one or more of my graduate students in an area of interest to discuss how you might assist on their team.  Ask for suggestions for what you need to learn.  The things you need to learn differ by project, which is why I can't make a universal list but generally includes: Python or Julia, Unix command line, git, project specific reading (journal articles and textbooks), and project specific tools like OpenMDAO or Star-CCM+.
- Volunteer some time working on small tasks with a graduate student and getting up to speed on the recommended tools/concepts. Proceed to next steps once you've learned some foundational skills and we (you, graduate student mentor, I) have identified a project would be a good fit for a semester-length undergraduate project.

Next Steps (~10 hrs/week for one semester):

- Send me a resume and statement of interest.
- Meet with me to setup a ME 497R where you can receive three elective credits working on a semester-length research project.  
- Continue learning about high performance scientific computing: [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/scicomp), [course notes](http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am583s2014/notes/index.html)
- Continue learning about aerodynamics (Hansen textbook for Wind, Anderson textbook for Flight).
- Meet weekly with your research team and graduate student mentor to report progress and discuss ideas.

Research Assistant (10-20 hrs/week on a continuing basis):

- With mutual interest (and sufficient funding) you will then be hired as a paid research assistant and expected to work towards high impact publications in collaboration with a graduate student(s).  In some cases you may lead a project, particularly if expecting to transition into a graduate student position within our group. -->

<!-- - Send me a resume and a one page statement of interest. -->
<!-- - Complete one of the following basic starter projects based on your interest.  Create a GitHub account, learn the basics of git, and create a new repository for this starter project.  Be sure to commit often and comment your code.
    - Wind: Create a wind turbine wake model in Python using the [Jensen wake model](http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/a-note-on-wind-generator-interaction(2ac0aed9-af5e-4a3e-94f0-6ca825631180).html).  Create a contour plot of the wind field around a single wind turbine, and allow the wind direction (direction the wind comes from) to be a user-selected variable.  Verify your model against results found in the paper.  Build Jared's fortran version.
    - Flight: Write a source panel method for an NACA airfoil using Julia.  Build XFOIL.   -->

<!-- so it would be helpful to be comfortable with a programming language.  Any language is fine but we primarily use the following (in order of frequency of use): Python (v2), Julia, Fortran, C, C++, Matlab.  We use Git for version control.  A useful resource to learn more about High Performance Scientific Computing is available here: .  If you are interested in CFD, you should work through some of the StarCCM+ tutorials that are available in the CAEDM lab. -->

<h2 id="new-graduate-students">New Graduate Students</h2>

<p>Your goal as a researcher is to make an impact for good in the world and improve the way we design wind and flight systems.  The primary way to make an impact is through tackling challenging and important questions, performing high-quality insightful work, collaborating with industry and other researchers, and sharing findings broadly at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

<p>In the following links are my notes on topics I ask all new researchers in our group to become familiar with.  Write down your questions so that we can discuss them during our next meeting.</p>
