<!-- ### How to get involved -->

<p>ME 273 is a prerequisite for all of our projects.  Some projects might require additional prerequisites like ME 312.</p>

<p>There are three ways to get involved: volunteer, ME 497R, or a paid position.  We generally discourage the volunteering route as it is difficult to maintain with a busy undergraduate schedule.  ME 497R is usually the ideal route for new researchers.  Registering for ME 497R opens up time in your schedule for research, and the course fulfills a tech elective towards graduation.  Registering for 3 credits requires at least 9 hours of work per week (2 credits for 6 hours is also possible).  The course is graded, and you will be expected to produce an end-of-semester report.  Completing a 497R in our lab usually leads to a paid position.</p>

<p>Those with more experience (either through other research labs, relevant internships, or coursework) may choose to apply directly to a paid position.  Most paid positions require a minimum one-year commitment (we also commit to you).  Our goal is to help each undergraduate student to contribute to impactful research publications.  It takes a semester or two just to get up to speed, and so short-term research commitments are significantly less effective.  This commitment is another reason why we recommend completing a 497R first.  The 497R project does not require any long-term commitment and gives both you and us a chance to see if a longer term role is a good fit.</p>

<p>To get started, learn more about ongoing <a href="../research">research projects</a> and look through some of the relevant <a href="../publications">publications</a>.  When you have identified some areas of interest, contact the corresponding <a href="../people">graduate student(s)</a> to learn more about what they are doing, when lab meetings are, and what needs they might have.  Almost all of our undergraduate hiring is driven by the graduate students needs, so you should go through them first to find opportunities.</p>

<p>Once you have identified a potential research area or two (in collaboration with one of the graduate students), send me a 2-3 paragraph description of the proposed project and schedule an appointment to come visit (preferably with your graduate student mentor).  If we decide that the project is a good fit for moving forward, you will then need to create a syllabus for the upcoming semester. Your syllabus should contain a week-to-week description of tasks, deliverables, and a reading/learning schedule.  Readings should come from journal papers recommended by the graduate student and textbook/course resources listed below under Reading and Learning.</p>

<p>At the end of your 497R you will turn in a summative report.  Follow the <a href="https://me.byu.edu/students/resources">BYU ME writing guidelines</a>.  It should be written in the style of a scientific conference paper.</p>

<p>If you are interested in pursuing graduate work in our lab, having taken ME 412 and ME 415 will be valued.  ME EN 312 is a prerequisite for both of those classes, which means you need to take 312 before your Senior year.</p>

**Project Description**:  The NOAA and ESRL have compiled Radiosonde Data into a database to be used for research with the disclaimer that the data is “recent, research-quality data that has not been subjected to production quality control procedures.”
The data is available for request in a raw FSL (ASCII text) format in batches of 25,000 soundings.
The project is to:

1. Request batches of sounding data at applicable bands of latitude and longitude at various times and dates.
2. Write a script to read in the files and parse the data for valid soundings at altitudes relevant to the HALE aircraft research project.
3. Appropriately average and plot the wind vs. altitude data.
4. Find an appropriate regression model for the data to be used in simulation.
5. Similarly, create a model for 99th percentile winds at relevant altitudes.

**Time Expected**: 5-10 hours depending on programming ability.

**Prerequisites**: ME 273

**Resources**:

- General Information page: <http://esrl.noaa.gov/raobs/General_Information.html>
- Data Request Page: <http://esrl.noaa.gov/raobs/>

<div id="eric1" class="bibtex message" markdown="1">

**Project Description**:  Our lab is currently developing a reduced-order wake model for vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) that will allow an optimizer to position VAWTs in a wind farm to minimizes wake interference. We have currently developed an initial wake model based on computational fluid dynamic (CFD) data from several VAWT simulations that is capable of predicting with reasonable accuracy the wake behavior of a single VAWT. We are looking to expand this wake model to include multiple wind turbines and their interacting wakes, exploring effects of various blade quantities and shapes, and better understand the three-dimensional nature of VAWT wakes. For this project, we are look for an individual to complete the following tasks:

1. Learn how to use and becoming familiar with Star-CCM+
2. Work with lower fidelity models to gain a basic understanding of wake interaction and guide decisions on where to focus CFD simulations.
3. Obtain additional VAWT wake data of single and multiple turbines

**Time Expected**: 5-10 hours

**Prerequisites**: ME EN 312.  Prior experience with Star-CCM+ preferred. Prior or current enrollment in ME EN 412 preferred.

**Resources**:

- [Paper](http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2741&context=facpub) on initial wake model.

<div id="eric2" class="bibtex message" markdown="1">

**Project Description**:  Sandia has developed a simulation code called CACTUS (Code for Axial and Cross-flow TUrbine Simulation) which allows a user to model turbines and obtain information about aerodynamic forces and wake velocity deficits in a matter of minutes. This allows for optimization of turbines in a reasonable amount of time due to the speed of the code. Currently, Sandia is in need of wake validation of a 34-meter vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) using the CACTUS code to ensure that the numerical methods match experimental behavior. This project entails:

1. Obtaining experimental VAWT data from Sandia documentation.
2. Running CACTUS with the correct parameters identified to reflect the VAWT geometry and speed.
3. Comparing the results of the CACTUS code to the Sandia data and report on the findings between the two.

**Time Expected**: 5-10 hours

**Prerequisites**: ME EN 273. ME EN 312.  

**Notes**:
The use of the CACTUS code could be expanded to explore novel configurations, parked and tilted VAWTs, and modify the code to handle multiple turbines.

**Resources**:

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">New Graduate Students</h2>

<p>Your goal as a researcher is to make an impact for good in the world and improve the way we design wind and flight systems.  The primary way to make an impact is through tackling challenging and important questions, performing high-quality insightful work, collaborating with industry and other researchers, and sharing findings broadly at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

<p>In the following links are my notes on topics I ask all new researchers in our group to become familiar with.  Write down your questions so that we can discuss them during our next meeting.  Many of these topics will be relevant to undergraduates in our lab as well.</p>
