      <h1 id="scientific-computing">Scientific Computing</h1>

<h2 id="document-as-you-go">Document as You Go</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Consistently use a lab notebook.  This can be a hard bound book or a digital notebook (e.g., <a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Create theory documentation (in addition to usage documentation) for any code you write</strong>.  Any derivation you do in your notebook that is used in your code, should be transferred to an electronic format attached with the code.  It is very common to revisit your code later, or for someone else to want to build on it.  If the theory isn’t carefully documented it’s going to be very hard to remember what you did or for someone else to try to figure it out.  A few minutes now will save you hours later (both for modifying code later, and for writing the methodology in your papers).  Here are some suggested formats:
    <ul>
      <li>Jupyter notebooks: this would be the most common default.  Easy to use and allows you to combine math/text/code, which is great for including examples or demonstrating usage.</li>
      <li>README: if the module is very simple and only requires a short amount of documentation (e.g., a wrapper module) a README file will suffice.  (Even with other documentation options you still  always have README to provide some a basic explanation of what the module does and how to get started).</li>
      <li>LaTeX PDF: If the theory is extensive a LaTeX document is often better because you can cross-reference equations, references, etc.  I’ll often use a combination of LaTeX for the theory and Jupyter for a tutorial.</li>
      <li>Read The Docs: This approach allows for professional-quality documentation.  It’s overkill for most of our needs, but if we are developing something for extensive public collaboration, then we would want to go this route.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use Docstrings and learn what the expected format is for your programming language.</li>
  <li>Comment your code.  Refer to where you found equations/values (e.g., reference your documentation or a textbook/paper).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="version-control-and-backup">Version Control and Backup</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">Version control</a> is essential.  We use version control to develop code, to write papers, to collaborate, to rollback changes, etc.  Use good commit statements so that you have a useful version history.  Version control is helpful even on individual projects.</li>
  <li>Our lab uses <a href="https://github.com/byuflowlab">GitHub</a> to host our repositories. If you are actively working in our research group, sign up for a GitHub account and send me your username so that I can add you to our team.</li>
  <li>For stand alone codes, our repository naming convention is all lowercase.  Avoid separators where possible, but if it will help readability use a dash to separate words, not an underscore.</li>
  <li>For a paper and associated code, our naming convention is leadauthorlastname[year]-shortdescription (i.e., ning2017-airfoil).</li>
  <li>Archive results in addition to the code that produced it. <a name="archive"></a> Also archive the code that you used to create plots.  This will save you a lot of time when regenerating plots.  Plot regeneration is often needed to create versions of your plots for your presentation, or in responding to peer-reviewer’s suggestions on your publications.</li>
  <li>Backup.  You <strong>must</strong> have your data, code, etc. backed-up in at least one other location and preferably two other locations.  At some point you will lose data if you do not have backups.  I recommend Dropbox (continuous cloud-based backup).  As a secondary back or for large files you can use Time Machine if you have an external drive, BYU’s J Drive, or a CAEDM group.  These later two network volumes have a large amount of space with nighty backup.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code-development">Code Development</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Document and comment your code in detail as you go.  I said this already, but it is important and rarely done enough!</li>
  <li><strong>Unit Test!</strong>  All major programming languages have easy to use unit test frameworks.  You need to test your code anyway so encapsulate the tests so you can run them later and help ensure correctness as you refactor later.  As you update code be sure to update your unit tests as well.</li>
  <li>Make effective use of whitespace and other delimiters to group logical sections together and make your code easier to read.</li>
  <li>Use descriptive variable names.</li>
  <li>If you find yourself writing a very similar piece of code more than once, you should refactor the code to create one function used in multiple places.  Having duplicate code opens up additional opportunities for bugs with version mismatches.</li>
  <li>Don’t try to write a large program all at once.  Break it down into small pieces. For each small piece be sure to thoroughly verify and validate (V&amp;V) it before moving on.  In this way you can build up large complex codes.</li>
  <li>Take this course: IT 515R Scientific Computing.
<!-- - Do code reviews, just like we do with paper reviews.  In other words, when a model is more or less complete, ask a couple peers to review and offer feedback on correctness as well as clarity and style.  Schedule a session with me to review code as well. --></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We use GitHub for more than just version control.  We also use it to track and discuss tasks and bugs through <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">Issues</a>, organize and visualize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">project progress</a>, perform <a href="https://github.com/features/code-review">code reviews</a>, and <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/">document</a>.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Sometimes a hard-to-find bug or missing concept goes unnoticed and ends up surfacing us much later when we are putting results together.  Frequent code reviews can help alleviate this issue.   -->

<!-- - For those interested in computational fluid dynamics, we primarily use StarCCM+ and SU2.  For the former, there are good tutorials available on the CAEDM computers.  
- My current text editor of choice is Atom, but depending on the programming language you are using, you may prefer a dedicated IDE.   -->

<!-- Some of the main packages I use include: script, uber-juno, latex, and zen. -->
