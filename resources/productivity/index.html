      <h1 id="productivity">Productivity</h1>

<p>Here are some tips from productivity research that I have found to be most helpful. Adapt as needed to your style.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completely eliminate distractions (e.g., shut down email, facebook, notifications, etc.).<a name="distractions"></a> This will be hard to do at fist, but you will be <strong>far</strong> more effective with focused periods of work punctuated by breaks, as compared to longer sessions with distractions.  Don’t try to “multitask”.  Periodic breaks are necessary to maintain focus at a high level.  Taking a walk is more restorative than surfing the web.</li>
</ul>

<!-- At the same time you should also take periodic planned breaks, where you get up and walk around.     -->

<!-- The principle of not multitasking is true generally in life&mdash;try to be present with the people you are with. -->

<!-- Research studies suggest that you leave residual attention on the task you switched from, and it can take up to 20 minutes to become fully engaged again.  The cognitive parts of our brains are not designed to multitask.   -->

<!-- Some studies suggest 90 minutes of work, followed by a 10-15 minute break is about optimal.  Because of our 50 minute class periods, I generally organize around 50 minutes of work with a 5 minute break. -->
<ul>
  <li>Do the hardest and most important thing(s) first each day, or more generally at the times when you energy is highest.  Tasks that are urgent (i.e., homework, things with deadlines) will get done.  Some of these are important and some are not so important.  The real danger is to let things that are critically important, but not urgent, slip by with only occasional attention.  You need to put these “big rocks” in your schedule first, then let the other things fit in or eliminate them if they are nonessential.</li>
  <li>You’d be amazed what you can accomplish with short but consistent efforts.  Research on writers suggests that they are <em>a lot</em> more productive when they write a little each day, as compared to more sporadic marathon sessions.  Figure out what is most important, and make sure you are doing at least a little bit each day on your most important tasks.</li>
  <li>Plan and schedule every day.  Set aside time to consider what is most important and what you should work on that day (or the next day if you like planning at the end of the day).  Of course, some adaptability is always needed, but without a schedule you are likely to spend too long on things that don’t need that much attention, or to put off things that are hard because you don’t feel like them at the moment.  Having the discipline to follow your schedule, and learning how to schedule effectively, will help you make progress towards your important goals, and help you avoid last minute scrambles.</li>
  <li>In addition to daily scheduling, you need to step back and periodically reevaluate your long term goals and objectives (maybe once a month or once a semester).  Focus on what is essential, and let nonessential things drop away.  There are a lot of good things one could do, but you need to make sure you are focused on what is best.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Be results oriented.  It is easy in research to let less important pursuits consume too much attention because they are easier.  For example, one can get caught up in excessive planning, code documentation, feature development, or  code testing (don’t misunderstand all of these are important!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Set boundaries.  You need to take care of your mental, physical, and spiritual health or your productivity will plummet.  Ensuring that you get adequate sleep is essential.  Honoring the Sabbath Day is not just good for your spiritual health, but a weekly complete break from work is good for your mental health.  As you get married, and particularly as you have kids, you will need to set boundaries on your evenings.  Sometimes you’ll still need to work in the evenings, but be deliberate about it as opposed to being in an always-on email-checking state.  If you don’t have kids, evenings may be one of the most productive working times for you, but you still need to set boundaries around some personal time each day where you can renew.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Go for an afternoon bike ride, go for a swim, etc. -->

<!-- Don't keep checking email after you go home.  You will be more mentally drained and won't really get any more done by responding to a couple more emails.   -->

<!-- Tackle hard things first, don't put them off.  At the same time don't try to tackle the hard things in marathon sessions.  First, you'll have a harder time finding a huge block of contiguous time.  Second, you'll get burned out and procrastinate starting it up again. You'll be amazed at what you can accomplish with short but consistent efforts. -->

<ul>
  <li>Usually the most important things we work on don’t come with their own deadlines.  You’ll need to learn to set and enforce your own milestones.  Setting them is easier, but enforcing them is hard.  Too often people blow by their own deadlines, and if there are no real consequences they rationalize and just make new deadlines.  Adaptability is always important, but treat your deadlines like you would homework or any other hard deadline.  Create real consequences if necessary.  Even better than negative consequences, create compelling rewards for achieving your internal deadlines.</li>
</ul>

<!-- If you're not careful, work will expand to fill the time allotted. -->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Batch less important tasks.  Email should be done in batches.  It’s much more efficient to wait a few hours and respond to 10 emails in one short sitting, then to respond to them sporadically throughout the day.  Keep a list of short tasks that need to be done.  When you only have a few minutes, and it would be ineffective to start on something new, you can knock out a few of these short tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Network.  Most people underestimate the importance of networking.  It is vitally important.  Get to know the other students and faculty members around you.  Don’t be afraid to email or approach people whose names are on the research papers you are reading.  More often than not they will be flattered to talk to you about their work.  At the same time, look for opportunities to mentor and help others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the day, keep in mind that productivity is not the real goal.  Its a means to an ends.  Don’t let yourself get caught up in defining your worth by your productivity.  You should maintain a hunger for growth or improvement, but never devalue your own great worth.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- ## A subset of related books I recommend

 I also list some books at the end, that I've found helpful.  

- How to Have a Good Day by Caroline Webb.  If you only read one of these, I recommend this one.
- Give and Take by Adam Grant
- Essentialism by Greg McKeown
- Overwhelmed by Brigid Schulte
- The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss (I actually don't like some of this book as, in my opinion, it cross the line ) -->
